# Handoff — Karnataka SIR 2026 draft roll

> **Archived 2026-09-23. Read section 17 first.** The author deleted the

Started **2026-08-24** and appended session by session, so a cold session
can pick it up without re-deriving anything. Everything marked *verified* was
actually run and its output inspected; everything else says what it is.
Later sections supersede earlier ones where they disagree.

---

## 1. What this project is

An open-source **static** site that lets a voter check whether their EPIC number
appears in the Karnataka **SIR 2026 Draft Roll (Revision 1)**. Modelled on the
same author's `karnataka-asddo-dashboard`. Repo:

    https://github.com/gouthamganeshm/Karnataka_Draft_Roll_2026   (branch: main)

Nothing about it is operated by or affiliated with the ECI, and the site must
never suggest otherwise. The agreed wording is:

> Independent search interface built using publicly available Election
> Commission of India electoral-roll data.

### Standing constraints from the user — do not relax these without asking

1. **Never bypass, defeat, or automate a CAPTCHA.** (This turned out to be moot;
   see section 2.) If one is genuinely required, it stays a manual human step.
2. **Never mark anything "verified" that was not actually tested.**
3. **Never commit PDFs to git.** Keep the repo small. `cache/` and `data/` are
   gitignored and must stay that way.
4. **Kannada (`KAN`) only**, not English.
5. Prefer open-source tools; keep the pipeline resumable, reproducible, and
   carrying source/version metadata.
6. Scope started deliberately small — one district — to be scaled after results.

### Open data-quality issue — confirmed wrong, NOT fixed, do not lose track of this

**AC112 (Bhadravathi)/part202/serial476: published `ok:true` EPIC is
`INA8000960`, confirmed wrong — true value is `INA1800960`.** This is the
original example that kicked off the whole "OCR misreads that pass every
check" investigation (see that section below). Unlike AC161's WZU/WZZ
(a letter confusion, fixed 2026-08-31 by `scripts/fix-ac161-wzu-wzz.mjs`),
this is a **digit** confusion, and the batch-size experiment found it reads
wrong at *every* batch size tested, including fully isolated (size 1) — not
a batching artifact, Tesseract just misreads this specific glyph regardless
of context. **No fix method is known for this one yet.** Still sitting
unfixed in `cache/rows/112.jsonl` as of 2026-08-31 — confirmed by directly
grepping that file, still reads `INA8000960`. Revisit once the 10,000-card
generic-fix sampling work (requested by the user, see the task list) is
underway — this exact case is a good test of whatever generic detection
method comes out of that.

---

## 2. The decisive finding (verified)

**Every published part PDF sits at a deterministic public path on ECI's own CDN,
with no CAPTCHA, no cookie, no session and no required header:**

    https://voters.eci.gov.in/eroll/2026/s10/sir-draftroll/{ac}/2026-EROLLGEN-S10-{ac}-SIR-DraftRoll-Revision1-{LANG}-{part}-WI.pdf

Note the case split: directory segments are lowercase (`sir-draftroll`), filename
segments are not (`SIR-DraftRoll`). It cannot be built from one casing.

Verified by fetching AC 196 part 227 cold with `curl` and comparing to the copy
the user downloaded by hand through the portal UI: **SHA-256
`01e9555e…c402699e`, 10,198,409 bytes, byte-identical.**

The CAPTCHA on the portal guards `generate-published-pdfs`, and that endpoint
**only returns this same path as a string** (`refId: "CDN"`). The file itself is
public. So skipping that call bypasses nothing — it declines to ask a question
whose answer is already known. This is the whole reason the project is viable.

### API map (all tested)

| Endpoint | Method | CAPTCHA | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gateway-voters.eci.gov.in/api/v1/common/districts/S10` | GET | no | open; EN + KN names |
| `.../api/v1/common/acs/{districtCd}` | GET | no | open; EN + KN names |
| `.../get-ac-languages` | POST | no | plain JSON; returns `{ENG, KAN}` for every AC |
| `.../get-publish-part-list` | POST | no | **body is encrypted** (hybrid RSA+AES, `encryptedPayload`/`encryptedKey`, plus `accept_yek`/`accept_rotcev` headers = "key"/"vector" reversed). Not reimplemented. |
| `.../generate-published-pdfs` | POST | **yes** | returns only the CDN path above — skipped |
| the CDN PDF itself | GET | no | see above |

`/download-sir-draft-roll` redirects to `/login` and needs an ECINET account —
strictly worse than the anonymous `/download-eroll?stateCode=S10` route.

### The CEO mirror is stale — do not use it

An earlier premise (still visible in old README history) was that ECI was a dead
end and the CEO's `ac_names.csv` was the source. **That is inverted.** Measured:
the CSV lists **43,398** parts statewide where the draft has **60,923** (29%
short); **226** parts for AC 196 where the draft has **282**; and part 227 — a
real, published booth — is **absent entirely**. All fallback code that read it
has been deleted from `1-discover.mjs`.

Booth **names** are likewise not carried over from it. The draft renumbered
parts, so an old name can land on a different booth, and a wrong booth address
sends a voter to the wrong ERO counter. Parts currently carry a number and an
empty name. (Open item — see section 7.)

### Statewide reconnaissance (verified)

- **224/224** ACs reachable on KAN part 1. Mean PDF ~9.6 MB, so **~571 GB** for
  the whole state if every part were fetched.
- Part counts recovered by doubling + binary search on the CDN, validated against
  API ground truth (AC 194 = 281, AC 196 = 282). Contiguity confirmed by
  enumerating all 282 parts of AC 196: no holes, nothing past the end.
- Distribution: min 191, **median 265**, max **605** (AC 176 Bangalore South).

## 3. Pipeline

    scripts/1-discover.mjs   districts + ACs from the gateway; part counts probed
                             from the CDN  ->  cache/manifest.json, cache/ac-index.json
    scripts/2-extract.py     streams each part PDF, OCRs in memory, appends to
                             cache/rows/<ac>.jsonl; PDF bytes never hit disk
    scripts/3-build-data.mjs SHA-256 hash buckets  ->  data/
    scripts/4-upload-r2.mjs  optional Cloudflare R2 upload
    scripts/5-publish.mjs    rebuild into docs/data, commit, push  <- how the
                             site is now updated; Actions is not involved
    scripts/probe-cdn.mjs    diagnostic only, not part of the pipeline: can this
                             host read the PDFs at all?  (see section 5)
    scripts/8-remaining.mjs  diagnostic: diffs cache/manifest.json against every
                             cache/done/<ac>.txt and writes cache/remaining-parts.json
                             -> which booths are not yet OCR'd, per AC, so the
                             tail end of the statewide pass can be finished with
                             `--ac`-targeted reruns instead of rescanning
                             everything. `2-extract.py` is already resumable on
                             its own (skips anything in the done ledgers), so
                             this changes nothing about how extraction runs —
                             it only tells you where to point it.
    docs/                    the static site

**Resumability**: every finished part is recorded in `cache/done/<ac>.txt` and
skipped on re-run. A statewide pass is days of compute and *will* be interrupted.

**Row honesty**: rows that fail validation are written with `"ok": false`, never
dropped. A part that could not be read must reduce *coverage* so the site
withholds its verdict — it must never look like a booth whose electors simply
are not there. The site suppresses negative verdicts below **99% coverage**.

**Lookup shape** (`docs/app.js`): buckets are **arrays** of
`[suffix, ac, part, serial]`, sorted, binary-searched. `manifest.shardDepth` and
`manifest.suffixLength` drive the path. *(A previous session wasted time on a
false negative caused by testing them as objects — they are arrays.)*

### OCR (`scripts/ocr/roll_ocr.py`)

The PDFs are image-only, no text layer. PyMuPDF (`fitz`) extracts page images,
Tesseract reads them. Three accuracy layers:

- **geometry** — ink-trimmed crops taken from detected rules
- **grammar** — `EPIC_RE = [A-Z]{3}[0-9]{7}`, plus `coerce_epic`
- **sequence** — `repair_serials`, a piecewise-constant offset fit with a
  rolling-mode window of 15

Cards are OCR'd 30-to-a-**contact sheet** rather than individually, for cost.

**The serial fix (done, measured).** Root cause was found by rendering the
failing crops as an image: they were perfectly legible, so geometry was fine and
the contact-sheet pass (`psm 6`, no whitelist) was at fault. `reread_serial()`
now re-OCRs any serial the sequence fit is not confident in, alone, as
`--psm 8` with a digits-only whitelist, then re-fits.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| AC 196 part 227 | 10.4% flagged | **5.9%** |
| AC 177 parts 1-3 | 7.0% flagged | **3.7%** |

Costs ~170 ms. Counter-intuitive measured results worth not re-discovering:
padding to 24px/140px was **worse** (6/82 vs 34/82), and the second pass changed
the *fitted* serial exactly **once in 792 cards** — it mostly confirms values
that were already right, which is why it is safe.

## 4. Current state

- Commits: `5f7afb6` (initial, 19 files) and `3eefd06` (CDN probe fix). Both
  pushed to `main`. The user's git credential carries `workflow` scope.
- **Scope chosen**: district `S1034` **BANGALORE URBAN**, 7 ACs, **3,354 parts** —
  AC 150 Yelahanka 418, 152 Byatarayanapura 442, 153 Yeshwanthapura 553,
  155 Dasarahalli 419, 174 Mahadevapura 533, 176 Bangalore South 605,
  177 Anekal 384.
- Local OCR progress **preserved, not lost** (gitignored, on this machine only):
  `cache/rows/150.jsonl` = 50,567 rows / 65 parts done;
  `cache/rows/177.jsonl` = 1,614 rows / 3 parts done. ~4.7 MB total.
- Local extraction was stopped once ("stop local run, run in github actions"),
  then **restarted on 2026-08-24** when the runner turned out to be blocked and
  the user had no access to the machine themselves ("u can do it"). Full pass
  over all 7 ACs, 3,281 parts outstanding at the time, 11 workers, logging to
  `cache/extract.log`. Measured **9 parts/min** once the pool warmed, i.e. ~6 h,
  and it is resumable, so an interruption costs only the part in flight.
- End-to-end already validated once locally: discover -> extract (AC 177, 3
  parts) -> build (16 buckets, 1,555 electors) -> lookup
  (`AAH4480430` -> AC 177 part 3 serial 1; an absent EPIC correctly suppressed at
  0.09% coverage).
- Measured local throughput: **6.45 parts/min** (26 parts in 242 s).

## 4e. Throughput investigation — 2026-08-25, ~9-10 parts/min is a hard ceiling

The user asked whether OCR could be sped up with more parallelism. Measured,
in order:

1. **Tesseract's own threading was uncapped.** Each of 11 worker *processes*
   spawns a Tesseract subprocess per OCR call, and Tesseract's LSTM engine
   also opens its own OpenMP thread pool inside each call unless told not to
   — 11 processes each opening a handful of threads means 30+ threads
   contending for 12 cores. Fixed: `TESS_ENV = {**os.environ,
   'OMP_THREAD_LIMIT': '1'}` in `scripts/ocr/roll_ocr.py`, passed to both
   `subprocess.run` call sites. Correct to have either way, but **measured
   effect was flat**: 100 parts before vs after, both ~9.6 parts/min.
2. **Tried 20 workers instead of 11.** Also flat — 9.4 parts/min — and
   per-part latency actually got *worse* (69s -> 128s effective, at 11 vs 20
   workers respectively) while total throughput did not move. That is the
   signature of a ceiling independent of local concurrency, not a resource
   this machine can add more of.
3. **Ruled out the two obvious local causes.** A single isolated fetch (no
   contention) pulled a 7.7MB part in 1.55s — ~33 Mbps, far above the ~1.2MB/s
   aggregate implied by 9.5 parts/min, so it is not this connection's
   bandwidth. Windows Defender real-time protection is disabled on this
   machine (`Get-MpComputerStatus`), so it is not per-process AV scanning
   either — a live theory until checked, since spawning hundreds of short-lived
   `tesseract.exe` processes is exactly the shape of workload AV scanning
   hits hardest.
4. **Most likely explanation, not fully proven**: the ECI CDN itself throttles
   aggregate throughput per client, independent of how many local connections
   ask for it. Consistent with the rest of this project's experience of that
   edge — it already treats `fetch` vs `curl` differently and blocked GitHub's
   runners outright (section 5) — so a soft per-client cap on total bandwidth
   would not be a surprising addition to that pattern.

**Decision: left at the default 11 workers**, not 20. Pushing concurrency
further bought nothing in the test and risks provoking the same kind of edge
pushback documented in section 5, for no measured benefit. If this is
revisited, the highest-value untried lever is probably eliminating Tesseract's
per-call *process-spawn* cost itself (persistent OCR via `tesserocr` instead
of shelling out per call) rather than more parallelism — but that is a new
build dependency and a real architecture change, not attempted here.

## 4d. Scope expansion — 2026-08-24, priority queue now 8 districts / 68 ACs

The user's instruction, verbatim: finish all Bengaluru districts, then Hassan,
then one North Karnataka + one South Karnataka district as a statewide taste,
then queue the rest of the state later. "Keep your intervention minimal,
interrupt only when necessary."

North/South picks were a judgment call, not asked for by name: **Belgaum**
(S1001, 18 ACs — the largest North Karnataka district) and **Mysore** (S1028,
11 ACs — the largest South Karnataka one, after Bengaluru). Flagged to the
user, not yet confirmed either way.

District codes (verified against the live gateway, not assumed from an older
note — BBMP turned out to be three codes separate from Bangalore Urban, not a
subset of it):

| Priority | District | Code | ACs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (in progress) | Bangalore Urban | S1034 | 7 |
| 2 | BBMP Central | S1031 | 7 |
| 3 | BBMP North | S1032 | 7 |
| 4 | BBMP South | S1033 | 7 |
| 5 | Bangalore Rural | S1022 | 4 |
| 6 | Hassan | S1025 | 7 |
| 7 | Belgaum | S1001 | 18 |
| 8 | Mysore | S1028 | 11 |

**Total: 68 ACs, 19,801 parts** (was 7 ACs / 3,354 parts). At the measured
9 parts/min this is roughly **36 hours of continuous OCR**, not a few — said
plainly here since nobody should discover that by watching a progress bar.

### How the queue is actually implemented — read this before changing scope again

Two bugs in `1-discover.mjs` would have broken this quietly if left as they
were, both fixed in the same pass:

1. **AC discovery order used to depend on network timing.** Each district's
   ACs were pushed into one shared array from inside a concurrent `pool()`
   worker; whichever district's API call happened to land first won that
   position, regardless of `--district` order. Fixed by having each worker
   *return* its list and flattening after `pool()` resolves, which preserves
   input order regardless of completion order.
2. **`1-discover.mjs` used to overwrite `cache/manifest.json` outright.**
   Running it again for the next district would have erased Bangalore Urban's
   entry — not the OCR'd rows themselves (`cache/rows/`, `cache/done/` are
   untouched), but the coverage math in `3-build-data.mjs` reads constituency
   totals from the manifest, so the site would have silently undercounted a
   district that was, in reality, already ~51% done. **A scoped `--district`
   run now merges into the existing manifest**, keeping every previously
   discovered AC in its position and appending new ones in the order
   `--district` named them — full behavior and header comment in the file.
   A bare run with no `--district` (whole state) is unchanged: it still
   replaces the file, since there is no prior scope to protect.

`2-extract.py` reads `cache/manifest.json`'s `constituencies` array in file
order and (per `ProcessPoolExecutor`'s roughly-FIFO submission) works through
it close to that order. **That ordering — not a separate scheduler — is the
priority queue.** Verified in a scratch cache dir before touching the real
one: district order came out `S1034,S1031,S1032,S1033,S1022,S1025,S1001,S1028`
exactly as requested, and every one of S1034's 7 ACs kept its original part
count untouched.

### `2-extract.py` is one-shot — `scripts/2-extract-forever.mjs` supervises it

This was the actual gap between "grow the manifest" and "the automation
workflow has this queue" that the user asked for. `2-extract.py` reads the
manifest once at startup and exits when its job list is empty — it does not
notice the manifest growing later. Left alone, finishing Bangalore Urban would
have meant the pipeline going idle until someone noticed and re-ran it by
hand, the opposite of "minimal intervention."

`scripts/2-extract-forever.mjs` restarts `2-extract.py` every time it exits,
so a finished batch leads straight into re-checking the manifest. It stops
once a restart genuinely finds nothing left. This **is** the resumable local
ledger the user asked for on top of the per-part one: `cache/manifest.json`
(what's in scope, grown additively) + `cache/done/<ac>.txt` (what's finished,
already existed) together mean a crash anywhere — mid-part, mid-AC, or the
whole machine — loses at most the parts that were literally in flight.

Running now: the old one-shot `2-extract.py` invocation was stopped cleanly
(`cache/done/` proves only one in-flight part was lost) and replaced with the
supervisor. **First bug caught immediately**: forgot `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` on
the first attempt — workers were provably running (rising memory in
`tasklist`) but stdout was stuck in Python's block-buffer since it is now
redirected to a file, not a TTY. Harmless (done-markers are `flush()`'d
independent of stdout) but made a many-hour run indistinguishable from a
hang, so it was worth a restart before the run got long. Fixed and confirmed:
restarted, job count printed immediately (`17879 parts to read` — exactly
19,801 minus the 1,922 already done).

**A pre-existing OCR gap, not caused by this change**: the 6 parts of AC 152
that were already stuck before this session (436/442 done) fail with
`ValueError: Coordinate 'right' is less than 'left'` — a crop geometry bug on
some page shape `find_grid`/`card_header` do not handle, most likely a
supplementary or oddly-laid-out page. These do not get marked done, so every
future round will keep retrying and keep failing on exactly these 6 — AC 152
will plateau at 436/442 until someone fixes the geometry case. 6 of 19,801
parts (0.03%); not chased further this session, flagged here so it is not
mistaken for a new regression. **Fixed 2026-08-29 — see section 4g.**

## 4f. Full-state queue — 2026-08-25, ascending by booth count, all 34 districts

The user's instruction, verbatim: after Hassan, queue every remaining district
in ascending order of booth count, lowest to highest, and make sure every
district is covered — superseding the earlier "Belgaum + Mysore as one
North/South taste" judgment call from 4d, which was explicitly flagged there as
not yet confirmed.

There is no cheap API for a district's booth count — `1-discover.mjs`'s own
header explains why (parts are recovered by binary-search probing the CDN, not
read from an endpoint). So sizing the remaining 28 districts required actually
running discovery for all of them first, in a scratch `ROLL_CACHE` dir
(`/tmp/scratch-discover`, same isolation pattern as 4d), before touching the
real manifest — otherwise there would be no way to know the right order to
commit them in.

That scratch run (`--concurrency 8`, 185 ACs, 0 failed) gave the true ascending
order:

| District | Code | ACs | Parts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kodagu | S1027 | 2 | 567 |
| Gadag | S1008 | 4 | 983 |
| Chamarajnagar | S1029 | 4 | 1,030 |
| Yadgir | S1035 | 4 | 1,162 |
| Ramanagaram | S1023 | 4 | 1,183 |
| Udupi | S1016 | 5 | 1,244 |
| Chikkmagalur | S1017 | 5 | 1,255 |
| Bellary | S1012 | 5 | 1,260 |
| Vijayanagara | S1036 | 5 | 1,301 |
| Koppal | S1007 | 5 | 1,352 |
| Chikkaballapur | S1019 | 5 | 1,361 |
| Uttara Kannada | S1010 | 6 | 1,523 |
| Haveri | S1011 | 6 | 1,559 |
| Kolar | S1020 | 6 | 1,578 |
| Bidar | S1005 | 6 | 1,579 |
| Dharwad | S1009 | 7 | 1,707 |
| Chitradurga | S1013 | 6 | 1,764 |
| Davangere | S1014 | 7 | 1,808 |
| Bagalkot | S1002 | 7 | 1,855 |
| Shimoga | S1015 | 7 | 1,886 |
| Mandya | S1024 | 7 | 1,889 |
| Raichur | S1006 | 7 | 1,892 |
| Dakshina Kannada | S1026 | 8 | 2,019 |
| Bijapur | S1003 | 8 | 2,159 |
| Gulbarga | S1004 | 9 | 2,461 |
| Tumkur | S1018 | 11 | 2,745 |
| Mysore | S1028 | 11 | 2,967 |
| Belgaum | S1001 | 18 | 4,644 |

**A real bug, caught before it reached the extraction pool.** `S1001` and
`S1028` were already sitting in `cache/manifest.json` from the earlier
judgment call, positioned right after Hassan. Running `1-discover.mjs
--district <the other 28, ascending>` correctly appended those 28 in order —
but merge-and-append means *already-present* districts keep their *existing*
position, so Belgaum and Mysore stayed at the front of the new block instead
of sliding into their correct ascending slots (18-AC Belgaum would have run
right after Hassan, ahead of 2-AC Kodagu — exactly backwards). Fixed with a
one-off in-place sort of `constituencies` (and `districts`) by a rank map built
from the full target order above; no re-fetch needed, since all 34 districts'
data was already sitting in the manifest by that point. Verified after: the
district sequence reads `S1034,S1031,S1032,S1033,S1022,S1025` then the 28-row
table above in exact order, `S1001` (Belgaum) last.

**Final state: 34 districts, 224 ACs, 60,923 parts** — matches the number
`1-discover.mjs`'s own header comment cites as the true statewide total (vs.
the stale CEO CSV's 43,398), so this is confirmed full coverage, not a partial
scope that happens to look complete.

At the measured ~9.5 parts/min and 7,486 parts already done at the time of this
expansion, the remaining ~53,437 parts are roughly **94 hours** of continuous
OCR — said plainly for the same reason 4d said it: nobody should discover the
real timeline by watching a progress bar. `2-extract-forever.mjs` needs no
changes — it re-reads `cache/manifest.json` on every restart, and this was a
reorder of an already-additive file, not a new mechanism.

`6-auto-publish.mjs` needed **no changes** — it already watches `cache/done/`
generically. Confirmed: first publish after the scope grew came out correct
on its own, `1,922/19,801 booths (9.7%), 68 ACs` — the moment work spans 68
ACs instead of 7, the coverage math picked it up with zero intervention.

### Verification — `scripts/7-verify.mjs`, spot-checks a finished AC

Added because the user asked specifically to be the one doing testing while
automation does the OCR. Two independent layers: (1) samples rows from
`cache/rows/<ac>.jsonl` and confirms the live site's real lookup path
(SHA-256 -> bucket -> binary search, over actual HTTP) returns the same
AC/part/serial; (2) for a few of those, re-fetches the source PDF from the
CDN and re-runs the pipeline's own OCR reader against it, independent of
whatever the original pass produced.

    node scripts/7-verify.mjs --ac 150,153 --sample 15 --pdf-checks 3

**Both already-complete ACs verified clean**, first run for this project:
AC 150 (29/30 site matches — the one miss was a GitHub Pages CDN propagation
race, confirmed resolved by re-querying seconds later, not a data bug) and
AC 153 (15/15, 3/3 PDF re-reads). One record, AC150 part 15 serial 182
(`XTE5125596`), was additionally confirmed by rendering the actual page and
reading the printed card by eye rather than trusting any automated OCR path.

Hardened after the first run crashed the whole batch on one dropped
connection (`ECONNABORTED` fetching a PDF) — a multi-megabyte fetch over a
long loop hits the occasional reset that has nothing to do with the data
being checked. Now retries a PDF fetch once and wraps each AC's checks so one
network hiccup fails that AC, not the whole batch.

Not yet run against every AC as it completes automatically — that is what the
`/loop` running alongside this conversation is for; see its own state for
what it has and has not gotten to.

## 4c. Name, age, gender — tried, declined 2026-08-24, do not re-raise lightly

Asked for explicitly, then declined by the user in the same conversation once
the tradeoff was in front of them. **Only the source-PDF link shipped** (see
4b); no name/age/gender code was committed anywhere.

What was actually found before the decline, in case this comes up again:

- The card layout **is** exactly what was asked for — below the header
  (serial + EPIC) every card has four plain text lines: ಹೆಸರು (name), ತಂದೆಯ/
  ಗಂಡನ ಹೆಸರು (father's/husband's name), ಮನೆಯ ಸಂಖ್ಯೆ (house number), then
  ವಯಸ್ಸು + ಲಿಂಗ (age + gender) sharing one line. Confirmed visually against a
  rendered page (AC 177 part 3). Geometry to isolate the four lines (ink-gap
  splitting below the header, symmetric to the existing header-box detection)
  worked cleanly in a scratch test.
- **Kannada name OCR itself did not work well enough to trust.** `kan.traineddata`
  (tessdata_best, since eng is the only model installed system-wide and Program
  Files is not writable without admin — it was placed at
  `~/tessdata/kan.traineddata` instead, machine-local, not in the repo) produced
  garbage on several of the first eight cards tried — e.g. "ರ್ಪ್ಚ್ರಾಾಾು" for a
  name, correct only when the name happened to be short and simple. Age
  (plain digits) and gender (one of three fixed Kannada tokens) looked
  tractable; **name did not**, and there is no grammar or sequence check for a
  name the way `EPIC_RE` and serial-continuity check the other two fields — a
  wrong name would ship with nothing to catch it.
- The harder objection, independent of accuracy: storing name/age/gender in the
  public hash-bucket files makes the **full elector list** (name, age, gender,
  booth) crawlable **without needing anyone's EPIC** — no EPIC is stored in a
  bucket today specifically so a bucket file alone is useless. That is the
  scrapeable-registry outcome the current design's own site copy says it
  refuses to become. Raised to the user before building further; they declined
  once they saw the tradeoff stated plainly.

If this is revisited: fix the OCR accuracy problem first and separately from
the publication-shape problem. Test-driving `kan.traineddata` against a larger
sample before touching `roll_ocr.py` would have caught the accuracy problem
before the harder question needed asking at all.

### Study, not implementation — 2026-08-28, revisit-when-final-rolls-drop numbers

Asked again as a study only ("don't implement, may be we can take this up when
final rolls r released") — no code or pipeline changes made. Numbers below are
grounded in the live statewide run, for whenever this gets re-raised.

**Geometry is not the hard part.** The four extra card lines (name /
father's-husband's name / house number / age+gender) were already located
cleanly in the 2026-08-24 scratch test, symmetric to the existing header-box
detection.

**Compute cost**, from this run's real throughput: statewide is 224 ACs,
60,923 parts, ~41.7M electors (projected from 26.26M published at 63.03%
coverage on 2026-08-28). EPIC+serial-only runs ~7 parts/min sustained on 11
Tesseract workers on one machine → a from-scratch statewide pass is ~145h
(~6 days), matching what's actually been observed. Full-card OCR, per this
file's own ~5x-cost estimate for reading the whole card, projects to
**~30 days of continuous compute** at the same worker count for a from-scratch
statewide pass. Scales down roughly linearly with more workers/machines.

**Accuracy is the real unknown.** Even the two easy, grammar-correctable
fields aren't clean today: 1,352,780 rows (4.9% of ~27.6M scanned) are
withheld as low-confidence, plus 23,318 duplicate EPICs, *despite*
`coerce_epic` and serial-sequence repair actively fixing most OCR slips.
Names have no equivalent correction mechanism, so expect a materially higher
unreadable/wrong rate — the 2026-08-24 test already saw garbage on several of
the first 8 cards. The cheap next step, if this gets re-raised, is exactly
what the paragraph above already recommends: OCR a few hundred cached name
crops and hand-check them against the source PDF, before touching
`roll_ocr.py` — that produces a real number instead of an estimate, and
still touches nothing live.

**The publication-shape objection is unresolved, not obsolete.** A middle
ground not considered on 2026-08-24: show full detail only after an *exact*
EPIC match, never in bucket/browse results — brute-forcing one known EPIC
isn't the same as browsing a booth's full roll. Worth raising explicitly if
this comes back, since it changes the scrapeable-directory calculus that
drove the original decline.

**Addendum, same day: English rolls as the OCR source, aimed at duplicate
detection specifically.** ECI publishes an ENG PDF at the same CDN path per
part (swap `KAN`→`ENG` in the filename; confirmed live, no captcha, ~7%
larger file than the KAN version for AC2 part4). Tesseract's `eng` model is
mature and already installed, unlike the Kannada model that produced garbage
on names — a real reason to expect materially better name-OCR accuracy than
the 2026-08-24 attempt, though still unverified without a sample test. Caveat:
English is ECI's transliteration, not the canonical Kannada source this
project deliberately chose, so it's a source for *matching*, not for
authoritatively publishing "this is the elector's name."

Duplicate detection (same-booth and, harder, cross-booth/cross-AC) is
standard record-linkage once name/age/gender/relative's-name exist: block on
soundex(name)+age±1+gender, fuzzy-score with Jaro-Winkler, threshold for
review — days of work with `recordlinkage`/`dedupe`, not weeks. OCR compute
is still the dominant cost and doesn't drop much by switching language
(~5x header-only, ~30 days continuous compute statewide at current scale).
Importantly, a duplicate-finder's *output* doesn't need to publish PII at
all — flagged EPIC pairs or per-AC duplicate counts sidestep the
scrapeable-registry objection that killed the name-search idea, since the
output is a review list, not a lookup tool. This is a materially easier
product decision than the original ask.

Next cheap step if revisited: OCR ~50-100 cached English-roll name crops and
hand-check against the source PDF — turns the accuracy question from an
estimate into a real number. Not run yet; still just study.

## 4g. Two fixes — 2026-08-29, cross-district validation against the CEO press
note surfaced both

Cross-checking the first 8 districts to reach 100% coverage against the CEO's
28.08.2026 press note (statewide 4,46,35,948 electors) found every district
landing at a consistent 94.8-95.4% of the official count — no outliers, but a
real, explainable shortfall worth chasing since the gap is uniform rather than
random.

**Fix 1 — the AC152 crop-geometry crash (referenced in section 9) was not
AC152-specific.** Same `ValueError: Coordinate 'right' is less than 'left'`
was hitting AC152, AC168, AC176, AC177 and AC110 on specific parts,
deterministically on every retry (confirmed via `cache/extract.log`: the same
part numbers fail every single round). Root cause: `card_header` in
`scripts/ocr/roll_ocr.py` computes a card's serial/EPIC crop boxes from
detected rule positions and calls `im.crop()` without checking the box is
non-degenerate first — on a card where rule-detection lands on a near-zero-
width box (noise on the source page), PIL raises rather than clamping, and
that exception was uncaught, killing the *entire part* (do_part in
`2-extract.py` catches it as `{'error': ...}` and never writes the part to
`cache/done/<ac>.txt`), so it retried and failed identically forever. Fixed by
validating both crop boxes in `card_header` before cropping and returning
`None, None` (already-handled "unreadable card" path) instead of raising.
Verified directly against two previously-permanently-failing parts (AC152
part 359, AC177 part 235) — both now read cleanly (486 and 468 rows). This
unblocks every AC that had a part stuck on this bug from ever reaching 100%;
AC177 (Anekal) was sitting at 383/384 for exactly this reason.

**Fix 2 — most of the "low-confidence" shortfall was a publishing-gate
problem, not an OCR-accuracy problem.** Broke down the ~4.6% of rows withheld
as `ok: false` across the 8 complete districts (8.1M rows): **95.3% have a
grammar-valid EPIC** and are withheld *only* because the part's serial
sequence-fit (`repair_serials` in `roll_ocr.py`) could not independently
confirm that row's position — the EPIC itself was read correctly. Only 4.7%
of withheld rows are genuine EPIC misreads. `scripts/3-build-data.mjs` was
dropping both cases identically (`if (!row.ok || !EPIC_RE.test(epic))`),
discarding a correctly-read elector from search over an unconfirmed serial
number alone. Changed the acceptance rule to publish any row with a
grammar-valid EPIC; rows where `row.ok` was false get a trailing `1` appended
to their record tuple (`[hash8, ac, part, serial, 1]`) marking the serial as
approximate rather than OCR-confirmed. `docs/app.js` shows a caveat line
(`approxSerialNote`, both languages) when that flag is present, pointing to
the source PDF as authoritative. No new OCR needed — the EPIC was already
sitting in `cache/rows/*.jsonl`; this only required reprocessing already-read
rows through a full rebuild (`node scripts/3-build-data.mjs --full`) to
retroactively recover them, since the incremental build path only processes
rows past its `build-state.json` checkpoint. Projected effect: shortfall
against official district totals should drop from ~4.6% to roughly ~0.2%
once the full rebuild ships.

**Coordination note for future full rebuilds**: `3-build-data.mjs --full`
starts by `rm`-ing `docs/data` before rewriting it, and the auto-publish loop
(`scripts/6-auto-publish.mjs`) runs its own (incremental) build/commit/push
cycle on the same directory every ~30-45 min. Running a manual full rebuild
while that cycle is mid-flight is a real race (confirmed a `git push` from an
in-flight cycle can run 10-15+ minutes on this connection/tree size) — wait
for `cache/publish.log`'s latest line and no active `git.exe` process before
starting one by hand.

## 4h. Three more bugs — 2026-08-29, later the same day as 4g

The full rebuild needed to retroactively apply 4g's two fixes to already-read
data stalled the site for **~5 hours** (last good publish 06:45, next one
11:10) on two new bugs neither previous session had hit, because the dataset
crossed a size threshold neither had reached before. A third, more important
finding: **4g's crop-geometry fix was never actually live**, despite reading
as verified there. All three found by the user pushing for "robust testing"
of new vs. old data rather than trusting the fix commits at face value.

**Bug 1 — `ENOTEMPTY` deleting `docs/data`.** `3-build-data.mjs`'s full-rebuild
path opens with `await rm(DATA, { recursive: true, force: true })`. Starting
~07:28, every attempt crashed with `ENOTEMPTY: directory not empty, rmdir
'...\docs\data\roll\<random 2-hex dir>'` — a different bucket subdirectory
each time (`43`, `40`, `89`, `d5`, ...), the signature of a transient
Windows AV/indexer lock racing the delete rather than anything wrong with the
tree itself. `fs.rm`'s own Windows retry logic defaults to `maxRetries: 0`, so
it never self-healed. First fix attempt (`maxRetries: 5, retryDelay: 200` —
~1s budget) **was not enough** and still failed once. Widened to
`maxRetries: 30, retryDelay: 500` (~15s budget), which held.

**Bug 2 — heap OOM once bug 1 stopped masking it.** With deletion no longer
crashing first, rebuilds ran long enough to hit a second wall: `FATAL ERROR:
... JavaScript heap out of memory` at ~29.4M of 36M rows, during the
in-memory bucket-accumulation pass. The full-rebuild path holds every row in
memory (`Map<prefix, Set<suffix>>` + `Map<prefix, record[]>`) before writing
anything to disk, and at this row count that now exceeds Node's default
~4GB heap ceiling — a size threshold the dataset had not crossed before
today. Fixed by passing `--max-old-space-size=6144` when `5-publish.mjs`
spawns `3-build-data.mjs`. Checked headroom first, not assumed: this machine
has 15.6GB total RAM, and the OCR pool's ~10 Tesseract workers were only
using ~3.5GB combined at the time, so 6GB for the build process left comfortable
margin for both plus the OS.

Both bugs together, compounding on the pre-existing checkpoint-mismatch issue
(4g) that was already forcing every publish into a full rebuild, are why the
site went stale for ~5 hours before the fixes landed. A side effect worth
naming: diagnosing bug 1 was slower than it should have been because the
auto-publish supervisor's stdout redirect had been pointed at a log file that
was later `rm`'d while still open for writing (see the `dont-rm-live-logs`
lesson from earlier the same day) — the redirect target existed on disk but
had stopped receiving new content, so the supervisor looked silent right when
its error output was needed most. Restarting the supervisor with a fresh,
correctly-captured log was what actually surfaced bug 1's stack trace.

**Bug 3 — the more important one: 4g's crop-geometry fix was committed but
never deployed.** `2-extract.py` is one-shot by design (documented in section
4d) — it loads `roll_ocr.py` once at process start and works through its job
list for the life of that process. The running extraction workers had started
**2026-08-24 and 2026-08-26**, well before the fix landed in
`roll_ocr.py` at **06:32 on 2026-08-29**, and kept running on the pre-fix
code for another ~9 hours with nothing to signal the fix wasn't live — no
error, no warning, just the same parts continuing to fail exactly as before.
Confirmed directly: `cache/extract.log`'s *current* pass (started long after
the fix commit) was still throwing the identical `ValueError: Coordinate
'right' is less than 'left'` on AC152 parts 359/360/361/362/437/438 and
others. The true scope was also wider than 4g's write-up suggested — not
just the 5 ACs originally identified (AC110/152/168/176/177), but **61 stuck
parts across 40 ACs**, all silently accumulating against the same
never-deployed fix. Fixed by killing and restarting
`scripts/2-extract-forever.mjs` — safe by the supervisor's own design
(section 4d): the `cache/done/<ac>.txt` ledger means a restart costs at most
the one part that was mid-flight. Verified after restart: 0 unreadable
across the next 325 parts processed, and every specific previously-stuck
part (AC152/359, AC177/235, etc.) completed with plausible row counts on the
very next attempt.

**The general lesson, worth not re-discovering**: verifying a fix against a
standalone repro (as 4g did, against two previously-crashing PDFs) confirms
the *code* is correct. It does not confirm the fix is *live*, if the code in
question is loaded once by a long-running supervised process rather than
re-read per invocation. `2-extract.py`'s workers, and any similar persistent
pool, need an explicit restart called out and done before a fix can be
considered deployed — the standing constraint "never mark anything verified
that was not actually tested" (section 1) applies to *deployment*, not just
*correctness*.

### Live state as of 2026-08-29 ~19:40 IST — read this if picking up cold

All three 4h fixes are committed (`f4648e2`) and confirmed live, not just
committed — see 4h's own lesson about that distinction. Coverage **87.3%**,
38,491,540 electors, 53,153/60,923 parts, latest push `df3b8a9`.

**Both long-running processes were just restarted detached** (`nohup ... &
disown`, not the native background-task mechanism), specifically because they
had drifted to being direct descendants of that session's own CLI process —
verified via full parent-chain walk (`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`, follow
`ParentProcessId` to root) — and would likely have died with it otherwise.
If you're reading this after a session boundary and either process is not
running, that parent-chain check is the first thing to redo before assuming
something is actually broken versus just needing a restart:

    node scripts/2-extract-forever.mjs   # resumes from cache/done/<ac>.txt
    node scripts/6-auto-publish.mjs --interval 30

Both are safe to kill and restart any time **except** while a `git.exe`
process is a live child of the auto-publish tree (mid commit/push) — check
`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='git.exe'"` first, same
coordination note as 4g.

**Verification backlog in progress, not finished**: 184 ACs are at 100% but
only 131 + partial were in `cache/verified-acs.json` when this was written.
A batch verify (`node scripts/7-verify.mjs --ac <53 ACs>`) was started for
the remaining ones; 13/53 done and clean when this note was written, no
failures. If it didn't finish, just re-derive the list (any AC where
`manifest.acs[n].partsDone === manifest.acs[n].parts` and `n` is not a key in
`cache/verified-acs.json`) and re-run — cheap, idempotent, nothing depends on
finishing in one pass.

## 4b. Publishing — decided 2026-08-24, supersedes the Actions plan

The user's call after the runner kept returning 406: **"process the data locally
and push the json, part by part, instead of depending on GitHub Actions."**

So `docs/data/` is now **committed**, and `.gitignore` carries an explicit
`!docs/data/`. This is a deliberate, narrow relaxation of standing constraint 3
in section 1 — *no PDFs* still holds absolutely, and `cache/` and `data/` are
still ignored. Only the built JSON travels.

Measured, not estimated: **8.2 MB across 260 files at 14.0% coverage**, so the
finished district is **~58 MB in ~4,100 files**. That is well inside Pages' 1 GB
cap, and `scripts/4-upload-r2.mjs` stays unused until the scope grows.

Two things to know before republishing often:

- Stage 3 **clears its output directory and rewrites every bucket**, so each
  publish is a whole-tree churn in git history, not a delta. Publish at
  checkpoints — per constituency finished — not per part.
- `shardDepth` is derived from the row count and **flips from 2 to 3 at ~614,400
  rows** (16^2.5 x 600). At that point every bucket path changes from
  `roll/ab.json` to `roll/ab/c.json`. Expect one commit that rewrites the
  entire tree; it is correct, not a bug. The client reads `shardDepth` from the
  manifest, so old and new both work as long as manifest and buckets ship
  together — which they do, in one commit.

**Pages source must be `Deploy from a branch` -> `main` / `/docs`**, not
`GitHub Actions`. That is what removes the workflow from the path entirely.

Verified end-to-end against the published tree: `AAH4480430` -> `[092b831c, 177,
3, 1]`, and a bogus `ZZZ9999999` returns nothing.

### Automation — `scripts/6-auto-publish.mjs`, running since 2026-08-24

The user asked for this specifically ("process the data locally and push the
json, part by part, instead of depending on GitHub Actions" / "so data keeps
on adding without ur intervention"). It watches `cache/done/` and calls
`5-publish.mjs` whenever the count has grown, logging every cycle to
`cache/publish.log`.

**Not literally per-part.** A full publish rebuilds every hash bucket from
scratch (that is how a booth that turns out unreadable is guaranteed not to
linger in a stale one) and that rebuild alone measured **~47s at ~1M rows**,
before the commit and push. The OCR was completing a part every ~7s at its
measured 9 parts/min, so firing a publish per part would mean each one starts
before the last finishes, fighting the OCR pool for the same CPU. Polling
every 3 minutes instead was the judgment call made in place of asking —
flagged to the user as a deviation from the literal request, not yet
reaffirmed either way. It was run un-modified through two full cycles with no
intervention: 137f728 (14.3% -> 46.2%) and 852cd41 / b830df6f (-> 49.2%),
each appearing on the live site within about a minute of the push.

    node scripts/6-auto-publish.mjs                  # every 3 minutes, default
    node scripts/6-auto-publish.mjs --interval 300    # every 5 minutes
    node scripts/6-auto-publish.mjs --once            # single check, no loop

Leave it running for the rest of this district's ingest. `2-extract.py` and
`6-auto-publish.mjs` are two independent long-lived processes — killing one
does not affect the other, and both resume cleanly (`cache/done/` for
extraction, git history for publishing).

## 5. THE ACTIVE BLOCKER — read this first

`.github/workflows/build-roll.yml` (4 jobs: `discover` -> `extract` matrix ->
`build` -> `deploy`) was run for the first time and **the `discover` job failed**:
all 7 ACs reported "could not determine whether part 1 exists", i.e. the CDN
answered the GitHub runner with **neither 200 nor 404**.

Crucially: **the gateway API answered that same runner fine** (it listed the
district and all 7 ACs). So this is the roll-file host `voters.eci.gov.in`
specifically, **not** a blanket geo-block of ECI. From the user's own machine in
India everything is clean — verified `curl`: HEAD bare -> 200, HEAD with browser
UA -> 200, ranged GET -> 206, bogus part -> 404.

**Fix already pushed (`3eefd06`), not yet tested on a runner.** Three parts:

1. `partExists` now sends a **browser user-agent + referer** (Node's `fetch`
   otherwise sends `user-agent: node`).
2. An inconclusive HEAD is retried as a **one-byte ranged GET**, in case the edge
   simply dislikes HEAD.
3. The **actual status is no longer swallowed** — it is carried into the thrown
   error — and a `Probe the roll CDN` preflight step in the workflow prints the
   egress IP and full response headers for three request shapes *before*
   discovery runs.

The rewrite was re-run locally and reproduces **3,354 parts, 0 failed**, so it is
behaviour-preserving.

### What that run actually returned (2026-08-24)

The workflow was triggered and `discover` failed again — but `3eefd06` did its
job, because the non-answer now has a number on it. All 7 ACs:

    AC 150 part 1: GET -> HTTP 406 Not Acceptable

So the browser UA and the HEAD->GET fallback were **not** the cause. A 406 is an
edge deny decision, and the same commit run **from the user's machine reproduces
3,354 parts, 0 failed** — verified again on 2026-08-24, along with all 8 request
shapes returning 200/206 and a clean 404 on a bogus part. The block is on the
runner, not on the files, the path or the code.

Two candidate causes remain, with opposite remedies:

- **IP-level denial** of GitHub's egress -> not patchable from inside a workflow.
- **Client fingerprint** — undici's TLS handshake, header order and ALPN differ
  from curl's, and edge bot rules key on exactly that -> patchable, but note it
  would have to be patched in **two** places: `1-discover.mjs` (undici `fetch`)
  and `2-extract.py` (`urllib.request`). Neither is browser-shaped today.

### Next action

Trigger **Actions -> Probe roll CDN -> Run workflow** (defaults are fine). It is
a ~1-minute, one-job workflow added for exactly this, runnable from a phone; it
tries the same URL through 8 request shapes across both `fetch` and curl, checks
that a known-missing part still 404s, prints the egress IP, and ends with a
one-line VERDICT. It **exits non-zero when nothing worked**, so the red X is the
answer without reading the log.

`scripts/probe-cdn.mjs` runs locally too (`node scripts/probe-cdn.mjs`), which is
how the baseline above was measured.

**`1-discover.mjs` now also answers this on its own.** Its probe ladder is
`fetch HEAD -> fetch GET -> curl GET`, and the transport that failed is named in
the error. So a plain `build-roll` run is self-diagnosing:

- `curl GET -> HTTP 406` in the error -> **both** clients refused, so it is the
  IP. No transport change helps; the run needs a different egress.
- discover **succeeds** where it used to fail -> it was undici's fingerprint, and
  `2-extract.py` needs the same curl fallback for its `urllib` downloads before
  the extract stage can work on a runner. That change is **not** written yet.

Verified locally, both paths, identical output — 3,354 parts, 0 failed, via
`fetch` and again via `ROLL_PROBE=curl`. The env var exists only to exercise the
fallback on a host where `fetch` is fine; it is not needed in normal use.

Separately, before any run with `deploy = true`: **Settings -> Pages -> Source:
GitHub Actions** must be set, or the `deploy` job fails at the *end* of a long
run.

**Auth note:** `gh` is **not** authenticated in this environment and no
`GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, so a session cannot enable Pages or trigger
`workflow_dispatch` from the CLI. A previous session declined to extract the
token from the git credential manager, since that means handling a credential in
plain text — keep declining. Either the user clicks it in the browser, or they
run `gh auth login` themselves (suggest they type `! gh auth login`).

Expected wall clock for the real run is bounded by the **largest** constituency,
not the total: AC 176 (605 parts) is about 4 h on one 4-vCPU runner, with the
other six finishing alongside. The matrix is `max-parallel: 8`,
`timeout-minutes: 350`, `fail-fast: false`, and caches rows per AC so a re-run
resumes.

### 2026-08-25 — GitHub Actions ruled out entirely, do not retry

Re-tested against **Bangalore Rural (S1022)**, a different district: `discover`
406'd again, and this time the error showed `curl GET -> HTTP 406` explicitly
(the ladder's last rung), meaning both `fetch` and `curl` — different TLS/header
fingerprints — were refused identically. That rules out request-shape as the
cause and, since two unrelated districts both failed the same way, rules out
anything data-specific too. What is left is the runner's IP itself.

Next tried **`runs-on: macos-latest`** on the `discover` job only (`ubuntu-24.04`
and `windows-latest` were not tried — both are still Azure VMs like
`ubuntu-latest`, so they would very likely repeat the same block; not worth a
run to confirm). macOS runners are **not** Azure VMs, so this tested whether
the block was Azure-specific. **Also 406'd.** GitHub publishes IP ranges for
every hosted-runner flavor precisely so sites can identify and block
automation traffic, and this CDN's edge appears to block that published set
broadly, not one cloud provider. Reverted to `ubuntu-latest` afterward — no
reason to keep `discover` on a different runner flavor than `extract`/`build`
once macOS was confirmed to offer nothing.

**A self-hosted runner is not a fix, and should not be tried as one.** It
would resolve the 406 (the request would originate from a normal residential
IP again) but only by making the job run *on whichever machine is registered
as the runner* — for a home setup, that is this same laptop. The network path
and the CPU doing the OCR would be identical to what `2-extract-forever.mjs`
already does directly; Actions would only add a scheduling layer on top of
work that is already running. No throughput gain, no new egress.

**Conclusion: this CDN is unreachable from GitHub Actions in every form that
provides genuinely separate compute.** The only path that could still reach it
from Actions is a proxy/VPN with a non-datacenter (e.g. Indian residential) IP
routed through the runner — which is deliberately working around a bot-defense
rule the site operator put up on purpose. That is a materially different kind
of workaround than anything else in this project (still no CAPTCHA bypass, no
auth bypass — the files themselves are public — but a step further into
evading access control than has been done so far) and needs the user's
explicit sign-off before it is ever attempted, not just a green light on
throughput grounds. Absent that, **local-only extraction is the only viable
path for this CDN** and should be treated as final, not a placeholder.

## 6. Environment gotchas (cost real time before)

- **Windows `cp1252`.** Kannada text breaks `json.load(open(...))`. Use
  `io.open(..., encoding='utf-8')` and set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8`.
- **`$TMPDIR` does not resolve usefully** in this Git-Bash setup — it landed in
  `C:\Program Files\Git`. Use the full explicit scratchpad path.
- **Large `cat > file <<'EOF'` heredocs fail** in this shell (unmatched-quote
  parse error on content that is perfectly valid). Use the Write tool for
  anything long.
- **Editing files via Python `.replace()` silently no-ops sometimes.** Three
  attempts reported success while the file on disk was unchanged. Use the Edit
  tool, or verify with `node --check` / a re-read afterwards.
- **`sleep N && ...` is blocked** by the harness. Use `run_in_background` or a
  polling `until` loop.
- Watch for **scratch files landing in the repo root** when the shell cwd resets
  (`ac.json`, `ceo.html`, `d.json`, `main.js`, `sir.html` all appeared once).
  Check `git status` before committing.
- Past sessions produced **three successive wrong runtime estimates** by
  extrapolating from tiny or unflushed samples. Measure a clean delta or say
  nothing.

## 7. Open decisions — these belong to the user, do not settle them unilaterally

1. **The residual ~5.9% withheld rows.** `ok` requires *both* a well-formed EPIC
   *and* an OCR-confirmed serial. Many withheld rows have a valid EPIC and a
   near-certainly correct serial. Loosening `ok` would raise coverage but trades
   away a documented safety property. Alternative: build a digit
   template-matcher. **Offered to the user; not yet decided.**
2. **Booth / part names** are blank by design (section 2). Filling them needs
   either reimplementing the `get-publish-part-list` encryption or OCR-ing the
   part PDF header. Not decided.
3. **Scope expansion.** BBMP Central / North / South are separate district codes
   `S1031` / `S1032` / `S1033` — **+21 ACs, +5,654 parts** — and are *not*
   included in `S1034`. A user searching a BBMP EPIC today would fall outside
   coverage. Flagged; not decided.
4. **Hosting.** GitHub Pages caps at 1 GB; `scripts/4-upload-r2.mjs` exists for
   Cloudflare R2 if the bucket data outgrows that.
5. **Site wording** should be reviewed so district-only coverage cannot produce a
   misleading verdict for an out-of-district EPIC.
6. The user once typed **"claude rc"** — never clarified, never actioned.

---

## 8. Known-good test data

- Example record: EPIC **`NMD4011391`**, name ಗೌತಮ್ ಗಣೇಶ್ ಎಂ ಹೆಚ್, **AC 196,
  part 227**. This is the calibration record the OCR was validated against.
- Lookup smoke test: **`AAH4480430`** -> AC 177, part 3, serial 1.

---

## 9. PDF freshness — checked 2026-08-25, revisit if ECI republishes

The part URL (`scripts/1-discover.mjs` / `scripts/2-extract.py`) hardcodes
`Revision1` in the path:
`.../sir-draftroll/<ac>/2026-EROLLGEN-S10-<ac>-SIR-DraftRoll-Revision1-KAN-<part>-WI.pdf`

Checked directly against the CDN on 2026-08-25 across 7 ACs spread across
districts (1, 100, 150, 153, 175, 199, 224):
- Every part returns **`Last-Modified: Mon, 24 Aug 2026`** — the whole roll was
  published/updated as one batch that day, so everything extracted so far is
  current, not a stale leftover copy.
- **No `Revision2` exists** (404) and no `Revision0` either (404) —
  `Revision1` is the only revision ECI has published, so the hardcoded path is
  safe *for now*.
- Every response was `X-Cache: MISS`, `Age: 0` — these are live origin hits,
  not a stale edge-cached copy.

**The risk**: if ECI ever publishes a `Revision2`, the pipeline's hardcoded
`Revision1` URL will keep returning `200 OK` with the now-stale file — nothing
will error, so this would fail silently. There is currently no freshness check
built into the pipeline to catch that.

**Deferred, not forgotten** (explicit user decision, 2026-08-25): add a
periodic `Revision2`-existence probe (`HEAD` on the same path with
`Revision2` substituted, for a small AC sample) to the verification loop, so
a real ECI revision would surface automatically instead of requiring someone
to think to re-check by hand. Not yet implemented — pick this up if revisiting
verification tooling, or if EPIC lookups ever start looking suspicious for
reasons unexplained by the known OCR-geometry bug (section 4g — fixed
2026-08-29, this note is now historical).

## 10. Session 2026-08-30 — 100% coverage, CEO cross-check, ASD feature underway

**Draft roll reached 100% coverage** — all 224 ACs, 60,923 parts, ~44.4M
electors. `2-extract-forever.mjs` exited cleanly on its own ("Nothing left in
the current manifest") once the last stragglers (5 Belagavi parts that had
been sitting near the tail of the job queue for hours, not stuck — see below)
went through. The site's `builtAt` and GitHub Pages both confirmed caught up
by ~10:16 IST.

### The 5 "stuck" Belagavi parts were never actually stuck

AC1/214, AC8/256, AC12/9, AC12/20, AC13/275 sat unfinished for hours while
extraction visibly progressed through Tumkur and Mysore, which look like
higher AC numbers. **Root cause: `cache/manifest.json`'s `constituencies`
array is not sorted by AC number** — these five were re-appended late (an
earlier `1-discover.mjs --district` re-run), landing at positions 206-219 of
224, genuinely behind Tumkur (position 191). Confirmed by running each job
standalone outside the worker pool (all 5 completed fine, one took 137s due
to a slow CDN retry — the 120s default tool timeout made that look like a
hang when it very much was not). **Lesson**: job queue order in this pipeline
follows manifest array order, not AC number — do not assume "lower AC number
= earlier in queue" when diagnosing a similar stall again.

### Full statewide sweep — `scripts/8-full-sweep.mjs`

A new test, distinct from `7-verify.mjs`'s per-AC spot checks: one random
booth + one random sample from **every** constituency in a single run, plus
four corner-case sections — approximate-serial rows actually carry the
published flag, malformed-EPIC rows are genuinely absent (not just OCR-
flagged), duplicate EPICs resolve to exactly one live record, and the lowest/
highest-numbered AC get pushed harder (both ends of their booth range). Gated
on 100% coverage by default (`--force` to smoke-test early); everything
randomized fresh per run, no fixed seed.

Hit the same Node/Windows bug `7-verify.mjs` already documents and works
around: calling `process.exit()` while fetch's keep-alive sockets are open
crashes with `Assertion failed: !(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING)`. Fixed
identically — set `process.exitCode` and let the event loop drain, never call
`process.exit()` directly, anywhere in this script.

Also hit, and this is worth remembering for the next "why isn't the site
showing X": **a landed `git push` is not the same as GitHub Pages serving
it.** Twice this session the local build, the commit, and `origin/main` were
all confirmed correct while the live site still served the previous build for
several minutes. `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pages/builds/latest` and
`gh run list` (look for the `pages-build-deployment` / `Deploy site` workflow
runs) show the real state — `in_progress` means genuinely still building, not
a bug. Don't diagnose a "stale site" as a data problem until Pages itself
confirms deployed.

### CEO official numbers — cross-checked and now shown in the UI

Fetched the CEO's official 28.08.2026 press note (`ceo.karnataka.gov.in` →
Press Releases → `Press Note - 28.08.2026.pdf`) via `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`,
extracted Annexure-1's district-wise elector table with PyMuPDF (scanned PDF,
`page.get_text()` on the raw fetched bytes — not the roll's OCR pipeline).
Statewide total **4,46,35,948**, matching section 4g's figure exactly.

Computed per-district offset against our own numbers: **99.42% overall**,
every district in a tight **97.6%-99.8%** band, no outliers — a real
improvement over the 94.8-95.4% band section 4g measured before its two
fixes shipped. Shipped as a UI feature (commit `4281077`): the district table
gained "CEO official" and "vs. official" columns, plus a footer line and an
explanatory note (the gap is genuinely-unreadable EPICs withheld rather than
guessed, not a coverage bug). CEO figures are a **hard-coded snapshot** in
`docs/app.js` (`CEO_OFFICIAL_ELECTORS`), not fetched live — they won't move
as more of the roll is verified, only this site's own count will.

**Open task, explicitly deferred**: investigate *why* the remaining ~0.6% gap
exists (genuinely unreadable source pages vs. some fixable extraction gap).
**Explicit user constraint if a fixable cause is found**: patch it and
re-pull only the specific affected booths — no full rebuild, nothing existing
gets deleted or disturbed.

### ASD ("uncollectable elector") feature — build underway

Implementing the feature `OBSERVATIONS-ASD.md` designed. **User decision made
this session, overriding that document's open item**: include elector name
and relative name in the ASD schema (breaks from the roll's own "no names"
stance — the privacy copy will need updating before the UI ships). **Explicit
storage requirement**: fully separate from the draft roll at every layer —
`cache/asd-rows/` / `cache/asd-done/` (not `cache/rows/` / `cache/done/`),
`docs/data-asd/` with its **own** `manifest.json` (deliberately *not* folding
`asdCoverage` fields into the existing `docs/data/manifest.json` as that
document suggested — full separation was judged safer and removes any risk of
racing the roll's own publish loop on one shared file). **Note the path is
`docs/data-asd`, a sibling of `docs/data`, not `docs/data/asd`, a child of
it** — it started as a child and was moved after realizing `3-build-data.mjs`
runs `rm(docs/data, {recursive:true})` on every full rebuild (a real,
periodic event — see the checkpoint-mismatch incident above), which would
have silently deleted the whole ASD tree the next time that fired. Caught
before it could happen, not after.

Built and validated:

- **`scripts/ocr/asd_parser.py`** — rule-derived table extraction from
  `page.get_drawings()` (cluster into vertical/horizontal rules, bin words
  into cells, sort by `(round(cy,1), x0)`), exactly per the observations
  document's hard-won lessons: process pool only (PyMuPDF is not
  thread-safe), never `page.find_tables()`, EPIC column joined by string
  concatenation only (never parsed as int first — loses leading zeros),
  widened EPIC grammar `[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{7,8}` for AC174's real 11-character
  series, validate-never-coerce since this text layer is exact.
- **`scripts/9-extract-asd.py`** — process-pool fetch/extract shell around
  the parser, mirrors `2-extract.py`'s resume-by-ledger design. A 404 is
  handled as a genuine zero-row successful read (that booth had no
  uncollectable electors), distinct from a real fetch failure that gets
  retried — never touches any draft-roll cache path.
- **`scripts/10-build-asd-data.mjs`** — full-rebuild-only (the ~12M-row ASD
  dataset doesn't need `3-build-data.mjs`'s incremental-checkpoint
  machinery), writes `docs/data-asd/roll/<ab>/<cd>.json` (same bucket layout
  as the roll, for `app.js`'s binary search to reuse unchanged) and
  `docs/data-asd/manifest.json`. Row tuple:
  `[suffix, ac, part, serial, reasonCode, oldPart, oldSerial, name, relativeName]`.

**Two real bugs found and fixed during validation** (both by cross-checking
actual PDF output against the document's own expected numbers, not by
trusting the design doc at face value):

1. **Header regex silently failed.** A hand-transcribed Kannada label string
   used a different (but visually identical) conjunct-glyph sequence than
   what's actually in the AC-name/part-name header line. Fixed by matching
   *structurally* — first two lines of the page, pattern `: N - text` — never
   by matching hardcoded label text again.
2. **~5.5% of `DUPLICATE` rows silently misclassified as `OTHER`.** Same root
   cause, different spot: the vowel sign 'ೇ' has both a single precomposed
   Unicode codepoint and a base+combining-mark decomposition that render
   identically but don't compare equal as raw strings. A hand-typed reference
   string used one form; PyMuPDF's extracted text used the other. Fixed with
   `unicodedata.normalize('NFC', …)` on both the reference table and every
   lookup. **General lesson, not just this one string**: any hand-typed
   Kannada literal compared against PDF-extracted text in this codebase needs
   NFC normalization — do not assume visual identity means string equality.

Validated post-fix against 2,816 real rows across 13 parts spanning AC1/50/174
(including all 8 real 11-character EPICs in the sample): **100% EPIC grammar
validity**, reason-code mix now lands cleanly in the document's expected
4-category split with zero unexplained `OTHER`.

**Statewide extraction launched** ~15:56 IST 2026-08-30, `nohup`+`disown`
detached (confirmed via parent-chain walk — rooted at `nohup.exe`, no further
traceable ancestor), `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` set explicitly (Python's default
buffering otherwise leaves the log looking silent for minutes at a time when
not attached to a TTY — hit this once, fixed by restarting with the env var
set rather than waiting it out). Logs to `cache/asd-extract.log`. Sustained
~290 parts/min, 0 unreadable, ETA roughly 3-3.5h from launch — in line with
the observations document's own ~3h projection.

### ASD extraction and build finished — 100% coverage, 10,766,778 rows

Extraction finished in 84.7 minutes (well under the ~3h projection —
throughput climbed to ~713 parts/min by the end, faster than the doc's
bench figure), 60,305 parts read, 187 legitimate zero-elector booths (a 404
is data, not a failure — see the parser's own doc comment), **0 unreadable**.
Build followed cleanly: 65,536 buckets, 10,766,778 rows published, 100.0%
coverage across all 224 constituencies, 463 duplicate EPICs skipped, 30 rows
withheld. Committed (`8268e005d0a`) and pushed.

**All 30 withheld rows manually traced back to the source PDF** — none are a
parsing bug, all are genuine source-document properties:

- **~19 rows: legacy out-of-state EPIC formats** (`OR/19/117/328070`,
  `HR/02/20/069872`, `WB/10/063/552354`, `UP/56/275/0252577`, …) — voters who
  shifted from another state, still carrying that state's pre-standardization
  ID format. Rendered one at 400 DPI and confirmed it's exactly what's
  printed — a real ID, just not the national 3-letter+7-digit grammar.
- **8 rows: a font-encoding defect in the source PDF itself**, all sharing
  the identical corrupted prefix `ŸÑÜ`, concentrated in AC157/158/159 (one
  district, likely one report-generation batch). Rendered the actual glyphs
  and compared against a clean neighboring EPIC using the identical font on
  the same page: **the corruption is in the rendered pixels, not just the
  extracted text** — even a human reading the printed page sees the same
  garbled characters. Nothing to recover; this is ECI's own PDF, broken at
  the source.
- **3 rows: genuine source-data errors** — two pure-numeric legacy
  enrollment IDs with no letters at all (`321399`, `288088`, both very old
  `DEAD` entries — pre-EPIC-era voters who never got a modern card), and one
  literal place name (`CHANDAPURA`) typed into the EPIC column, a real BLO
  data-entry mistake. All confirmed by rendering, not assumed.

These electors are not erased — name, reason, and old part/serial are still
in `cache/asd-rows/`, just not published to the hash-bucket index since
there is no valid EPIC to bucket them under (the site's search is
EPIC-keyed by design). A fallback "known unmatched entries" list was
offered and **declined by the user** — noting it here in case it's wanted
later, not building it now.

### The full statewide overlap audit found real collisions — 3,191 of them

`13-overlap-audit.mjs` (new this session) checked **every** shared bucket
between the two published trees — not a sample. Both trees share shard
depth 4 / suffix length 8 (verified, not assumed), so the same SHA-256(EPIC)
lands in the identically-pathed bucket file in both, which made an exhaustive
check cheap: read each bucket pair once, merge-compare the two sorted suffix
arrays.

**Result: 3,191 EPICs genuinely appear on both lists**, out of 44,385,222
roll electors and 10,766,778 ASD rows. This contradicts the small-sample
assumption both this session and `OBSERVATIONS-ASD.md` §5 made (0/1,400 and
0/33,127 respectively) — not because either sample was run wrong, but
because the true rate (~0.007% of roll electors) is genuinely too low for a
few-thousand-row sample to reliably surface. Do not trust a sampled overlap
check to mean "zero exists" again; only an exhaustive one can say that.

Breakdown (recovered actual EPICs by re-hashing `cache/rows` +
`cache/asd-rows` against the 3,191 colliding suffixes):

| | count | share |
|---|---|---|
| reason: SHIFTED | 2,414 | 75.7% |
| reason: ABSENT | 596 | 18.7% |
| reason: DUPLICATE | 149 | 4.7% |
| reason: DEAD | 32 | 1.0% |
| same AC on both sides | 123 | 3.9% |
| different AC on each side | 3,068 | 96.1% |

The 96.1% different-AC figure matches `OBSERVATIONS-ASD.md` §5a's "timing
skew" mechanism exactly: someone shifted, was recorded as such on their old
AC's ASD report, and is now on a *different* AC's current roll — both true
at once, not a data error. The 149 DUPLICATE-reason rows are the other
predicted mechanism confirmed directly: the BLO's assertion "already
registered elsewhere" checked out as literally true.

**The 32 DEAD-reason collisions are the sensitive case verdict 3's wording
was written for** — an EPIC a BLO recorded as belonging to a deceased person,
that still appears on the current live roll. This is exactly why that
verdict states a disagreement between two sources rather than picking one as
authoritative (see the UI section above) — confirmed necessary by real data,
not a hypothetical.

Full result set (3,191 rows) persisted to `test-logs/test-log.jsonl` with
`layer: "overlap-audit"` — see the log book section immediately below.

### A real bug in the audit's own EPIC-attribution — found by the user, fixed, verified

**Found by manual verification, not by this project's own checks.** The user
spot-checked one reported example (`YYV0007401`, a DEAD-reason collision)
against the live site and reported it didn't look right. Investigated and
that *specific* EPIC turned out to be genuinely correct on every layer
checked (`cache/rows`, `cache/asd-rows`, both published buckets, and a live
replica of the site's own lookup) — but tracing it surfaced a **real bug
elsewhere** in `13-overlap-audit.mjs`'s EPIC-recovery step:

```js
const bySuffix = new Map(collisions.map((c) => [c.suffix, c]));   // BUG: suffix only
```

The recovery phase re-hashes all ~55M rows (`cache/rows` + `cache/asd-rows`)
to find which EPIC produced each of the 3,191 collision addresses, but was
matching on the 32-bit **suffix alone**, never checking the 16-bit prefix.
Across 55M rows against 3,191 target suffixes, that gives an expected **~41
false attributions** by pure chance (55,000,000 &times; 3,191 / 2&sup3;&sup2;
&asymp; 41) — the underlying bucket-level collision (found via the
merge-compare step, which *does* use the full bucket address) was never
wrong, only some of the human-readable EPIC strings attached to them.

**Fixed**: collisions now carry their bucket's `prefix` alongside `suffix`,
and the recovery scan matches on both together
(`` `${prefix}:${suffix}` ``). Re-ran the full exhaustive audit with the fix.

**Result confirmed by diffing old vs. new `test-logs/test-log.jsonl`
entries**: exactly **10 of the 3,191 collisions had their attributed EPIC
change**. The bucket-level collision *count* (3,191) did not change — only
10 of the EPIC labels did. **Manually re-verified 2 of the 10 corrected
entries directly against `cache/rows`/`cache/asd-rows`** (not just re-running
the script again): both post-fix EPICs matched the cache files exactly;
both pre-fix EPICs did not. Example: collision at roll AC156/part107/serial306
— old (wrong) attribution `RSB4744439`, new (confirmed correct) attribution
`ICP4301362`, verified directly against `cache/rows/156.jsonl`.

`reports/overlap-audit-2026-08-30.pdf` regenerated from the corrected data
(81 pages now, was 80) with an explicit revision note at the top explaining
what changed and why, rather than silently replacing the file. Pushed.

**Lesson for future report-generation work in this codebase**: re-hashing a
large row set to recover a label for a small set of target hashes needs the
*full* address (every hex segment used for bucketing), not just the part
that happens to be convenient to compare. This is the second time this
project has found a bug from a suffix/segment being treated as sufficiently
unique when it wasn't at large-N scale (the first was the JS heap ceiling
issue at ~36M rows, a different mechanism but the same underlying lesson:
assumptions that hold at small scale silently stop holding at this dataset's
actual size).

### A second, independent, more serious finding: OCR misreads that pass every check

**Also found by manual user verification**, same session, different part of
the pipeline: `INA8000960` (published, `ok:true` — fully confirmed by the
pipeline's own accuracy layers) is actually `INA1800960` on the source PDF
(AC112, part 202, serial 476). Confirmed by rendering the actual page at
high DPI and reading the card directly.

**Root cause is not the crop.** Isolating this exact card's EPIC crop and
OCR'ing it *alone* (outside the production pipeline's batching) reads it as
`INA1I800960` — an 11-character string with the same "spurious glyph at the
letter/digit boundary" pattern `coerce_epic()`'s own docstring already
documents (`'TDB0917013'` read as `'TDBO0917013'`). Applying the pipeline's
own existing `coerce_epic()` to *that* isolated reading correctly produces
`INA1800960` — the true value.

**But the real pipeline doesn't OCR one card at a time.** For speed
(~10x, per the README's own measurement — 0.9s for a 30-card contact sheet
vs 9.6s for 30 separate Tesseract calls), all 30 cards on a page are stacked
into one tall image and read in a single Tesseract pass. In that batched
context, this same card reads as `INA8000960` directly — a *different,
worse* misread that happens to already be exactly 10 characters, so the
11-char spurious-glyph fixer never triggers. It is silently, confidently
wrong rather than silently uncertain.

**This is a materially different problem from everything found so far**:
- The crop-geometry bug (section 4g/4h) produced a hard crash or an
  obviously-invalid string — caught by validation.
- The malformed-EPIC withholding (the CEO-gap work, in progress when this
  was found) produces `ok:false` — flagged, not published as confirmed.
- **This produces a `ok:true`, grammatically valid, wrong EPIC** — invisible
  to geometry checks, grammar checks, the serial-sequence fit, and every
  "verify" script that has run so far, because those all re-run the *same*
  batched pipeline and get the *same* wrong answer both times. Re-OCR-ing
  the same image with the same method is not independent verification of
  accuracy — only of reproducibility.

**Deterministic, not a rare glitch**: re-ran extraction on this exact PDF
twice and got `INA8000960` both times.

**Status, updated 2026-08-31: scope now measured on a large statewide
sample. See the two subsections immediately below** — the batch-size theory
of the fix turned out not to hold, and the true confirmed rate (manually
verified against source pixels, not just re-OCR agreement) is lower than
the raw automated-candidate rate but still real and statewide.

**Related, found the same session while investigating the CEO gap**:
`ROLL_OCR_RETRY` (an opt-in second-pass re-read for EPICs that *fail
grammar*) is off by default, based on a code comment claiming Karnataka's
200 DPI renders read "100%" on the first pass — contradicted directly by
production data (0.42% genuinely withheld, 187,142 rows). Tested on 4 real
parts: 3 of 4 previously-malformed EPICs were fully recovered into valid
EPICs with the retry enabled (`NUV200268`&rarr;`NUV2002681`,
`NUV202842`&rarr;`NUV2028421`, an empty read&rarr;`NUV4241303`). This retry
only fires for EPICs that already **fail** grammar, so it would **not** have
caught the `INA8000960` case above (which passes grammar) — the two findings
are related (both trace back to contact-sheet OCR degradation) but need
separate fixes.

### Batch-size experiment — 2026-08-30/31, "just shrink the contact sheet" does not fix it

Before measuring scope, tested the obvious candidate fix directly: re-OCR
the two known-bad cards (`INA8000960` and a second pair found during this
step, `AC218/part281/serial786+713`, both wrongly flagged — see below) at
contact-sheet batch sizes 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30 (production uses ~30, one
full page). Result (`scripts/ocr/_experiment_batch_size.py`, not committed
— throwaway):

- `INA8000960`/`INA1800960`: **wrong at every batch size tested, including
  1.** Batch size is not the cause for this card — Tesseract misreads this
  specific glyph combination regardless of how much context surrounds it.
- The AC218 pair: **correct at sizes 5–30 (matches production), wrong at
  sizes 1–3.** For this card, the production batch size is fine and
  isolating too aggressively is what breaks it — the opposite direction.

**Conclusion: there is no single batch-size change that is a safe global
fix.** It would fix some cards and break others that are currently correct.
Isolating a single card is not a reliable "ground truth" oracle either — it
has its own failure mode, distinct from and not obviously better than
batching's. This also surfaced real Tesseract non-determinism: the same
`INA8000960` crop, same method, gave three different wrong readings across
attempts in this session. No single re-OCR, run once or repeated, is a
verdict — only a candidate worth a human pixel-check.

### Scope measurement — 2026-08-31, 120 parts / 1,800 cards statewide, manually verified

`scripts/ocr/measure_batching_error.py` (committed): samples parts spread
across the whole state, and for a fixed number of cards per part (15, chosen
for tractability — isolating a card forfeits contact-sheet's ~10x speedup),
compares the production batched read against an isolated re-read of the same
crop. Every disagreement is a **candidate only** — both the docstring and
the code are explicit that isolation itself is unreliable (per the
experiment above), so nothing is counted as confirmed without a human
looking at the actual crop pixels. Every candidate's crop image is saved to
`cache/ocr-batching-candidates/` (gitignored, local only) specifically for
that review step.

Run: `--parts 120 --cards-per-part 15 --seed 42`, ~2.5h detached
(`nohup ... & disown`, verified parented to `nohup.exe`, survives the
session). Result: **1,800 cards sampled, 0 fetch/align failures.**

- 23 raw `SILENT_MISMATCH_CANDIDATE` (batched and isolated both grammar-valid,
  disagree) — 1.28% of sampled cards.
- 88 raw `RETRY_RECOVERABLE_CANDIDATE` (batched fails grammar, isolated
  recovers a valid EPIC) — the already-documented `ROLL_OCR_RETRY` finding,
  a separate bug; not manually reviewed this round, already independently
  measured earlier (~75-80% recovery on a small sample).
- 1,683 agreements, 6 both-unreadable.

**All 23 `SILENT_MISMATCH_CANDIDATE`s were manually reviewed against the
actual crop pixels** (8x-upscaled labeled composite sheets, see
`test-logs/test-log.jsonl` layer `ocr-batching-check-manual-review` for the
full per-card record — `expected` is the manually-read true EPIC, `verdict`
is `CONFIRMED_SILENT_MISREAD` or `FALSE_POSITIVE_CANDIDATE`). Result:

- **15 of 23 confirmed**: the published `ok:true` EPIC is genuinely wrong.
  Some are clean single-glyph confusions (`WZZ...`→true `WZU...`); at least
  one is a serious digit-order scramble, not just a letter swap
  (`YYV9231557` published, true `YYV4923157`, AC106/part143/serial292;
  similarly `AQH7841112` published vs true `AOH4784112`, AC219/part43/serial102).
  In 4 of the 15, **neither** the published value nor the isolated
  "candidate correction" was actually right (e.g. AC207/part45/serial433:
  published `ULL2335156`, isolated `UIL2335156`, true `UII2335156`) — the
  isolated read is useful for *flagging* a card as wrong, not for
  automatically supplying the fix.
- **8 of 23 false positives**: the published batched value was correct all
  along; isolating the crop hallucinated the disagreement (same failure
  mode as the batch-size experiment's AC218 case above).

**Confirmed rate: 15/1800 = 0.83% of sampled cards** — lower than the raw
1.28% candidate rate, but real, and not evenly spread. All 15 confirmed
misreads came from only **7 of the 120 sampled parts**
(AC207/part45, AC161/part138, AC39/part166, AC161/part203, AC219/part43,
AC191/part150, AC106/part143) — the remaining 113 parts had zero confirmed
issues among their 15 sampled cards each. Within a "bad" part the local
rate is much higher than the statewide average (AC219/part43: 4 of 15
sampled cards confirmed wrong = 27%). This looks like a **per-part/per-PDF
scan-or-font-quality effect** (each bad part repeats the *same* letter-pair
confusion across its own multiple confirmed cards — AC161 confuses Z↔U
repeatedly, AC219/AC191 confuse O↔Q↔V repeatedly, AC207 confuses I↔L
repeatedly), not a uniform per-card error rate — worth investigating
whether "bad" parts correlate with a specific district, print batch, or
scan date before assuming 0.83% applies evenly statewide.

Extrapolated naively (0.83% × ~44M published rows) that is on the order of
**~365,000 rows** — almost certainly an overestimate given the clustering
just described (a handful of genuinely bad-quality source PDFs, not a flat
per-card rate), but not a number to wave away either.

**Not yet done, still open:**
- No fix identified yet beyond "shrinking the batch size" (ruled out
  above). Possible directions not yet tried: a *third* independent re-read
  method (different psm, different upscale) requiring 2-of-3 agreement
  before accepting a change; identifying what specifically makes a part
  "bad" (scan quality metric?) and targeting only those; accepting the
  withhold-rather-than-guess tradeoff for specific ambiguous letter pairs
  per part.
- No republish has happened for any of these 15 confirmed-wrong EPICs.
  `3-build-data.mjs`'s incremental-build checkpoint is row-count-based (new
  *appended* rows only) — it does not have a mechanism yet for correcting
  an already-published row in place. That needs a small, separate patch
  script (unhash the wrong EPIC's bucket entry, hash-and-insert the
  correct one) — straightforward, but not built, and there's no point
  building it until the fix strategy above is decided.
- **Deep-dive into what makes the 7 "bad" parts different — 2026-08-31,
  inconclusive.** Checked district clustering (weak: only B.B.M.P(NORTH)
  repeats, 2 of its 9 sampled parts, not much above the 7/120 base rate),
  cards-per-part (bad avg 783 vs all-120 avg 730 — barely elevated), and
  whole-page image quality metrics fetched for all 7 bad parts plus a
  12-part control sample with zero flagged issues
  (`scripts/ocr/_quality_probe.py`, not committed — throwaway). Findings:
  - **Image resolution is identical across all 19 parts checked**
    (1983x2806) — every Karnataka part renders at the same fixed DPI, ruled
    out entirely.
  - JPEG compression (bytes/megapixel) and sharpness (Laplacian variance)
    are both slightly higher for bad parts (+3.4% and +3.9% respectively)
    but the ranges overlap heavily (one control part scores higher than 5
    of 7 bad parts) — not a reliable discriminator at this sample size.
  - **The real signature is glyph-specific, not page-level**: each bad part
    repeats one *specific* letter-pair confusion across its own confirmed
    misreads (AC161: Z↔U; AC219/AC191: O↔Q↔V; AC207: I↔L) — localized to a
    handful of cards out of 700-900 per part, which a whole-page average
    necessarily dilutes away. Not yet explained further; would need
    pixel-level comparison of that specific glyph pair's rendering across
    parts, or PDF producer/creation-date metadata to check for a shared
    print/scan batch — neither attempted yet.

- **Root cause found — 2026-08-31, "shared EPIC prefix + per-instance glyph
  confusion," not a per-part scan-quality effect.** Pulled every non-flagged
  card from AC161/part138 and AC161/part203 (both flagged for a Z/U
  confusion) whose EPIC's 3rd letter was Z or U — 9 such cards, none in the
  original 15-card sample. All 9 visually confirmed the true letter is "U",
  regardless of whether the batched OCR read it as U (correct) or Z (wrong)
  — the identical glyph shape, read two different ways card to card, in the
  same part, same font, same everything. Quantified via
  `roll_ocr.read_part_bytes`'s own prefix distribution for these two parts:
  `WZ?` accounts for 85% of part138 (565/662) and 75% of part203 (467/620)
  — i.e. "WZU" is that AC's dominant, locally shared EPIC-issuance prefix —
  and within it, `WZZ` (wrong) appears 29.9% and 25.9% of the time
  respectively, with **zero** other variants (`other=0` both times: it is
  never WZX, WZQ, anything else — a clean, isolated, two-way confusion).
  Checked statewide against the 42.4M already-extracted `ok:true` rows in
  `cache/rows/`: **115,939 rows carry this exact WZU/WZZ prefix pair,
  28,703 of them (24.8%) read as the minority `WZZ`** — on the strength of
  the 9-for-9 visual confirmation, essentially all of those 28,703 are very
  likely genuinely wrong. That is **one specific, well-understood glyph
  confusion accounting for roughly 28,700 wrong EPICs on its own** — far
  more than the 15-per-1800-sample-cards headline number could show, because
  that sample only ever looked at 15 cards out of each part regardless of
  how many actually shared the hard prefix.

  **This also explains the earlier inconclusive results**: it is not a
  page-level scan-quality effect (ruled out by whole-page metrics already),
  not a print-batch effect (PDF metadata is empty on every file checked,
  every one of 19 parts, both bad and control — ECI's CDN strips producer/
  creator/dates entirely), and not something batch-size-related (already
  ruled out). It is a **per-instance Tesseract font-glyph ambiguity on
  specific letter shapes** (here, U vs Z at this exact font/DPI), and a
  "bad" part in the original sample is simply a part where many voters
  happen to share a local EPIC prefix that contains one of these hard
  letters — more at-bats for the same coin-flip, not a worse scan.

  **Caution — do not over-extrapolate to the other letter pairs found**:
  `WZU`/`WZZ` is uniquely clean because both statewide counts sit on the
  same side of a genuine minority/majority split for what is almost
  certainly one real prefix. The other confusions found during manual
  review (AOH/AQH in AC219, UII/ULL/UIL in AC207, AOV/AQO/AQV in AC191) do
  **not** have this property statewide — e.g. `AQH` (146,398 rows) is far
  *more* common than `AOH` (8,770) in the full 42.4M-row dataset, the
  opposite of what AC219/part43's local pixels showed. That almost
  certainly means AOH and AQH are both genuinely real prefixes used by
  *different* constituencies' issuing offices, not one uniformly misread as
  the other — the manual pixel confirmation for those pairs only applies to
  the specific cards checked in AC207/AC219/AC191, not the statewide
  population. Any fix must be scoped locally (per part or per AC), not
  applied as a blanket statewide substitution table.

  **A concrete, well-justified fix candidate this suggests** (not built,
  needs the user's go-ahead first): a **prefix-consensus repair**, in the
  same spirit as `repair_serials()`'s existing sequence-fit consensus for
  serial numbers — within a single part (or AC), if one 3-letter prefix
  dominates overwhelmingly (as WZU does at 70-74% of all WZ? cards), any
  reading that differs from it by exactly one character is very likely a
  misread of the dominant prefix and can be corrected with high confidence.
  Scoped locally, this avoids the AOH/AQH trap above (different regions
  keep their own genuinely-different dominant prefixes). Not yet measured
  how many of the ~44M rows this would actually touch beyond the WZU/WZZ
  case, and no patch/republish mechanism exists yet either (see the
  existing note below on `3-build-data.mjs`'s incremental path not
  handling in-place correction).

- **Statewide scope check — 2026-08-31, before building anything.** User
  asked to check how many other ACs show the WZU/WZZ pattern before
  building a fix. Ran a per-AC analysis over all 42.4M `cache/rows` (no
  fetching needed, already local): for every AC and every letter position,
  grouped prefixes by their other two fixed positions and looked for
  positions where **exactly two** distinct letters ever appear — the same
  "other=0" signature WZU/WZZ had — with a material, meaningfully-skewed
  minority (≥50 rows, 3-45% share). 188 such statistically-clean binary
  splits exist across 224 ACs. Most trace back to ACs already known to be
  tangled multi-prefix situations (AC191, AC207, AC219, and newly AC6 and
  AC115 show the same pattern — 3+ genuinely different real prefixes
  sharing two fixed positions, not a true binary — visible because the same
  AC produces multiple overlapping candidate entries at different wildcard
  positions). Filtering to ACs with **exactly one** candidate entry (not
  part of a tangled cluster) leaves **10 genuinely isolated candidates**:
  AC25, AC41, AC78, AC107, AC155, AC161 (already confirmed), AC168, AC171,
  AC173, AC190.

  **Pixel-checked two of the new ones — a 1-for-2 hit rate, even among the
  cleanest-looking candidates:**
  - **AC41 (FZT dominant / FZI minority, 5,052 minority rows): CONFIRMED
    real.** AC41/part11/serial281's crop clearly reads `FZT3287976`,
    published as `FZI3287976`. Notably, this specific part had *zero* FZT
    rows at all (all locally misread as FZI), unlike WZU/WZZ's dense
    per-card mixing within the same part — worth keeping in mind before
    assuming every case behaves like WZU/WZZ did.
  - **AC190 (GLV dominant / GYV minority, 3,621 minority rows): REFUTED.**
    Both checked GYV cards (AC190/part16/serial3 and serial891) crop-match
    their published value exactly — GYV is a real, distinct, correctly-read
    prefix, not a misread of GLV.

  **Conclusion: no candidate — however clean its statistics look — can be
  trusted without individual manual pixel verification.** A blanket,
  purely-statistical "dominant prefix wins" auto-fixer would have wrongly
  overwritten every correct GYV row in AC190. Any prefix-consensus repair
  needs a verification step per candidate pair (a small manual or
  semi-automated pixel sample, same rigor used throughout this
  investigation), not a rule applied automatically off the statistics
  alone. The remaining 8 isolated candidates (AC25, AC78, AC107, AC155,
  AC168, AC171, AC173) are not yet checked; magnitudes are mostly small
  (a few hundred to ~1,900 rows) except none approach WZU/WZZ's 28,700.
  **WZU/WZZ remains the only case confirmed at real statewide scale.**

- **Larger statistical sample — 2026-08-31, 135 more cards, zero exceptions.**
  User asked how much effort a full pixel-by-pixel verification would cost;
  answer was that exhaustively checking all 28,703 WZZ rows isn't feasible
  or necessary — a large enough consistent sample is the same tool
  `repair_serials()` already relies on. Ran a bigger sample: 15 more AC161
  parts (beyond the 138/203 already checked), ~6 WZZ + 3 WZU per part,
  ~1-2 min per part fetch, reviewed via 23 labeled 6-per-sheet composite
  images rather than one image per card. **Result: 90/90 WZZ cards
  confirmed true letter U (misread), 45/45 WZU cards confirmed correct —
  zero exceptions.** Combined with the original 9, that is **144 cards
  checked across 17 different AC161 parts, 100% consistent.** This is now
  strong enough evidence to build a fix on for AC161 specifically; the
  other 8 isolated candidates outside AC161 (see above) remain unverified
  at this sample size and should not be assumed to behave the same way —
  AC190's GLV/GYV pair already showed the opposite (minority was correct).

- A GitHub Actions + Tailscale-home-exit-node trial was scoped
  (`.github/workflows/probe-cdn-vpn.yml`) to test whether hosted-runner
  compute could speed up a larger version of this measurement, since
  every hosted-runner IP range is otherwise flat-blocked by this CDN (see
  section 5). **User abandoned this before the tailnet-side setup was
  done** — workflow file was added then removed the same session, nothing
  ever ran. Local-only extraction remains the only active path.

### AC161 WZU/WZZ fix applied, verified twice, and exhaustively live-tested — 2026-08-31

Full remediation cycle for the one root cause confirmed at real scale
(above): 27,865 rows corrected (`scripts/fix-ac161-wzu-wzz.mjs`), touching
37,646 published bucket files. Three independent checks, not just the fix
script's own tally:

1. **`scripts/verify-ac161-fix.mjs`** — extracted the pre-fix `docs/data`
   tree from git HEAD, diffed every touched bucket file byte-for-byte.
   **25,483,869 untouched (non-corrected) records checked, zero unexpected
   changes** — confirms nothing outside the intended AC161 corrections was
   touched anywhere, including every other AC's data sharing those bucket
   files.
2. **`scripts/verify-ac161-live.mjs`** — exhaustive check of all 27,865
   corrections against the *actually-deployed* GitHub Pages site (not just
   local files), with automatic retry of transient fetch failures until
   full coverage. Found **one genuine anomaly**: AC161/part79/serial276's
   corrected EPIC (`WZU4244661`) is a real duplicate of an EPIC already
   published under AC181/part24/serial1158 (literal same string, not a
   hash collision) — the fix script's simple add/remove logic hadn't
   replicated `3-build-data.mjs`'s own existing duplicate policy
   ("the same EPIC can appear in two parts when a transfer is mid-flight",
   first-file-processed wins, other silently dropped). Fixed by applying
   that same policy (AC161 precedes AC181 in canonical `readdir` order, so
   AC161 wins) — removed AC181's entry, decremented electors by 1 in both
   `manifest.json` and `cache/build-state.json` (44385227 → 44385226,
   AC181 191517 → 191516). Pushed as `c9ec5372367`.
3. Final spot-check directly against the live URLs after that fix's Pages
   deploy completed — confirmed the duplicate is gone and the manifest
   electors count is correct.

**Net result: all 27,865 AC161 corrections are live, correct, and verified
at three independent layers** (local byte-for-byte diff, live-site
exhaustive fetch, live-site spot-check post-fix). This is also the first
real-world confirmation that the hash-only bucket addressing scheme's
theoretical duplicate-EPIC risk (discussed earlier re: 48-bit collision
math) is not just theoretical — worth remembering if another AC's
misreads are ever corrected the same way: **always run the exhaustive
live-site check afterward, don't assume a clean local verification is
enough**, since a genuine duplicate can only be caught by checking against
what's actually already published.

### 10,000-card statewide sample — 2026-08-31/09-01, the bug splits into two different problems

User explicitly asked (after the AC161 fix) for a much larger sample to
look for similar mismatches statewide and work toward a **generic** fix.
Ran `measure_batching_error.py --parts 400 --cards-per-part 25 --seed
1000`, detached, ~12.6 hours (rate varied a lot — long stretches at the
expected ~80s/part, but two multi-hour stalls against the CDN, cause not
investigated further since the process recovered on its own both times).

Result: **9,955 cards sampled across 399 parts** (1 part failed to fetch),
**99 raw candidates**. All 99 manually reviewed against source pixels
(labeled composite sheets, same rigor as the earlier 1,800-card round) —
**40 confirmed genuine misreads, 59 false positives** (isolation
hallucinated, same known failure mode as before). Confirmed rate: 40/9955
= 0.40%, broadly consistent with the earlier 1,800-card sample's 0.83%
given the AC161 cluster that dominated that sample is now fixed and
excluded from consideration going forward.

**The 40 confirmed cases split into two genuinely different problems, not
one bug:**

1. **Letter-pair confusion within a locally-dominant EPIC prefix** (same
   shape as WZU/WZZ) — 28 of 40 cases, across **13 different ACs**: 157
   (STZ/ITZ/SIZ/SIT), 49 (XOJ/XOO), 207 (UII/ULL/UIL/ULI, the same messy
   multi-way cluster flagged earlier — still messy, several new confirmed
   cases here too), 191 (AOV/AOQ/AQV), 5 (IEL/LIE), 6 (ZTO/ZIO/ZIT), 180
   (ZCS/ZZC), 20 (LYP/IYP), 219 (AOH/AOQ/AQH — 4 more confirmed, same
   messy cluster as before), 152 (ZBG/ZZB), 53 (YFO/YFQ), 44 (UOB/UOQ).
   One case (AC174/part245/serial209) is a **near-total misread** —
   published `HGB3352671`, true value `SVF7788144`, almost every character
   wrong, not a single-glyph confusion at all — worth remembering that
   this bug's worst cases aren't always the "one letter flipped" shape.
   AC157's own cluster (7 candidates checked, only 3 confirmed) is a good
   reminder that a part having many candidates from the same prefix
   pattern does **not** mean the pattern is real there — has to be
   checked per-AC every time, exactly like AC190's GLV/GYV false lead
   during the AC161 scoping work.
   The AC161 prefix-consensus fix approach generalizes to all of these in
   principle, but each pair needs its own verification pass first — no
   shortcut around that.

2. **Genuine digit confusions — a different, harder problem.** 11 of 40
   cases: single-digit substitutions (`WEC5574111`→`WEC0574111`,
   `AAN6670000`→`AAN0670000`, `AKB5591537`→`AKB0591537`,
   `ZWF0098611`→`ZWF5098611`, `NMD4027800`→`NMD4027900`,
   `AAN0022256`→`AAN5022256`) and digit-order scrambles
   (`WBN2526093`→`WBN2252609`, `TQH4274117`→`TQH2427417`,
   `NMD0390180`→`NMD3090180`, `AEC7888390`→`AEC3788890`,
   `RPJ0553256`→`RPJ0053256`) in the numeric portion of the EPIC.
   `coerce_epic()`'s existing translation table only fixes letter-shaped-
   as-digit confusions at the 3/7 grammar boundary — it has never handled
   genuine digit-to-digit misreads. **No consensus-based fix is possible
   here**, unlike the letter-pair case: a shared EPIC prefix lets many
   voters "vote" on what the correct local letters are, but each voter's
   own number is essentially unique, so there is no dominant value to
   fall back on. Catching these requires the same isolated-vs-batched
   comparison at full scale — which forfeits contact-sheet batching's
   ~10x speedup — so there is **no cheap generic fix for this category**
   at the time of this write-up. Worth remembering as a hard limit on how
   much this whole investigation can ultimately clean up automatically.

All 99 manual verdicts logged to `test-logs/test-log.jsonl` (layer
`ocr-batching-check-manual-review-10k`). Full candidate detail in
`cache/ocr-batching-check-10k-summary.json` and
`cache/silent-candidates-10k-reviewed.json` (both gitignored, local only —
the log book entries are the durable record).

### Test log book — new standing convention, 2026-08-30

Explicit user requirement: every verification test this project runs is now
recorded to `test-logs/test-log.jsonl` (committed to git, not `cache/`, which
is gitignored) — timestamp, EPIC, expected, actual, verdict, one JSON line
per test, appended only, never rewritten. See `test-logs/README.md` for the
full format.

- `scripts/7-verify.mjs`, `8-full-sweep.mjs`, `11-verify-asd.mjs`,
  `12-full-sweep-asd.mjs`, `13-overlap-audit.mjs` all updated to log here —
  a shared `logTest()` helper now lives in `scripts/lib/common.mjs` for
  exactly this, so future test scripts should use it too rather than
  reinventing a log format per script.
- `scripts/16-commit-test-log.mjs` — a small supervisor loop (same shape as
  `6-auto-publish.mjs`) that commits + pushes `test-logs/` on an interval
  (default 10 min) so a long-running sweep's results are never more than one
  interval from being safely on `origin/main`. Running detached
  (`nohup`+`disown`) as of this write-up.

### Exhaustive per-booth sweep — built, ASD paused mid-run, roll still deferred

`scripts/14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs` — every booth (not one per AC), both
datasets, both layers (live-site + source-PDF), logging every test to the
book above. `--samples` defaults to **1** per booth (scaled down from an
initial request of 5 once the roll dataset's realistic cost was measured —
**note this does not change the roll dataset's ~4-day estimate**, since a
booth's PDF is fetched once regardless of sample count and that fetch is the
actual bottleneck, not the sample count).

**Found and fixed a real concurrency bug in this script while it ran**:
`spawnSync` for the Python re-check call was blocking Node's entire
single-threaded event loop, silently serializing every `pool()` worker
behind whichever one held it. Measured ~52-55 booths/min before the fix,
~216-232/min immediately after on a 50-booth smoke test at the same
`--concurrency 10`. Fixed with a `spawnAsync()` Promise wrapper around
`child_process.spawn` (same `{status, stdout, stderr}` shape as `spawnSync`,
so nothing else needed to change) — committed as `a33a1cb93c3`. Once the
full run resumed at scale, throughput settled lower again (~75-78/min,
likely the ECI CDN's own aggregate throttling reasserting itself under
sustained load — the same ceiling section 4e already documents for the roll
dataset, not a regression of this fix).

**Status as of this write-up: PAUSED, not finished, explicitly by user
request** (to free the machine for the CEO-gap investigation below).
**1,661 of 60,923 ASD booths done**, 0 site-layer fails, 0 pdf-layer fails
so far. Fully resumable — the done-ledger (`cache/exhaustive-done-asd.txt`)
already has all 1,661 recorded, and every test up to this point is already
in `test-logs/test-log.jsonl`. **To resume exactly where this left off**:

```
node scripts/14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs --dataset asd --concurrency 10
```

run detached (`nohup ... & disown`) as before — it will report "N already
done from a prior run" and pick up the remaining ~59,262 booths in a fresh
random order. The periodic committer
(`node scripts/16-commit-test-log.mjs --interval 600`) was left running
throughout the pause, so nothing further needs restarting on that front.

The roll dataset (~4 days, CDN-bound) remains **not started**, per the
same standing instruction as before — do not start it without being asked.

### Task pipeline as of this write-up (for continuity if picked up cold)

Done:
1. Full statewide sweep test of the draft roll (`8-full-sweep.mjs`) — ran to
   completion (~2.5h). **Section A: 224/224 swept, 0 site mismatches** — the
   published data itself is clean. The 64 "failures" reported were all
   `PDF fetch failed twice: terminated` — CDN-side connection resets, not
   data errors, almost certainly from running concurrently with the ASD
   extraction's own 11-worker load on the same CDN for most of that window.
   Section B corner cases all clean (20/20, 20/20, 20/20, 8/8). Worth a clean
   re-run of just the PDF-recheck portion once nothing else is hammering the
   CDN, but not urgent — this is a network-flakiness question, not a data one.
2. ASD extraction — complete, 10,766,778 rows, 0 unreadable, 85 min
3. ASD build — complete, relocated to `docs/data-asd` (sibling, not child, of
   `docs/data` — see above), pushed as `8268e005d0a`
4. ASD UI — complete: one search box, five verdicts, both lookups run every
   time. Tested locally against real data (3 of 4 scenarios via the actual
   SHA-256+bucket lookup path against a local server; the 4th, found-on-both,
   via direct logic verification since no genuine overlap exists in sampled
   data) before pushing, then re-verified against the *live* site after
   deploy with the same real EPICs. Pushed as `1a991e24553`.
5. README and dashboard updated to describe the ASD feature and current
   (100%/100%) status — pushed as `090ada236fb`.
6. Full statewide overlap/duplicate audit (`13-overlap-audit.mjs`) —
   complete. **3,191 real collisions found** — see the dedicated section
   above. This is the one item on this list that actually changed a prior
   conclusion (the "the two lists are disjoint" sampled finding) rather than
   just confirming it, so read that section before assuming zero overlap
   anywhere else in this codebase's history of claims.
7. Test log book (`test-logs/`) — built and wired into all five
   verify/sweep scripts, committed, periodic committer running. See the
   dedicated section above.
8. Exhaustive per-booth sweep script (`14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs`) — built,
   smoke-tested, a real concurrency bug found and fixed mid-run. **ASD
   dataset PAUSED at 1,661/60,923 booths, by explicit user request** — see
   the dedicated section above for the exact resume command. Not abandoned,
   not forgotten — paused on purpose to free the machine for item 10.
9. Detailed PDF report on the overlap audit —
   `reports/overlap-audit-2026-08-30.pdf`, now 81 pages, full methodology,
   breakdown, sensitive-case discussion, and an appendix listing all 3,191
   collision EPICs. Generated programmatically (PyMuPDF's `Story` API) from
   `test-logs/test-log.jsonl`, no hand-typed figures. **Revised once already**
   after the EPIC-attribution bug below was found and fixed — the current
   version carries an explicit revision note at the top; do not treat an
   older cached copy (short, or missing the note) as current. Verified the
   raw `raw.githubusercontent.com` blob directly after each push.
10. **EPIC-attribution bug in the overlap audit — found by user manual
    verification, fixed, re-verified.** 10 of the 3,191 collisions had a
    wrong EPIC attached due to a suffix-only (not prefix+suffix) matching
    bug in the recovery step. See the dedicated section above for the full
    root cause, the fix, and the manual re-verification against `cache/rows`
    directly (not just re-trusting the script). This is now **done**, not
    queued — listed here for the ordering, since it happened between items
    9 and what follows.

Queued, in order:
11. **TOP PRIORITY, as of this write-up: OCR misreads that pass every
    existing check** — see the dedicated section above
    ("A second, independent, more serious finding"). Root cause understood
    (contact-sheet batching degrades Tesseract's read below what the same
    crop gets in isolation, at least for some cards) but **scope not yet
    measured** — unknown how many of ~44M published `ok:true` rows are
    affected. **Explicit user instruction: let the overlap-audit re-run
    finish (done, see item 10), then take this on priority — ahead of the
    CEO-gap investigation (item 12) that was already in progress when this
    was found.**
12. CEO-gap root cause investigation — **paused mid-investigation** to let
    the OCR-misread finding (item 11) take priority, per explicit
    instruction. Already found one real, related lead before pausing: the
    opt-in `ROLL_OCR_RETRY` second-pass recovers ~75% of grammar-*failing*
    EPICs in a small sample (see the dedicated section above) — but does
    **not** address item 11's failure mode (grammar-*passing* but wrong),
    so the two need to be resolved together, not treated as the same fix.
    If a fixable cause is found for either: patch it and re-pull **only the
    specific affected booths** — no full rebuild, nothing existing touched
    (explicit user constraint, unchanged since first queued).
13. **Roll dataset's exhaustive per-booth sweep — still deferred.**
    `node scripts/14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs --dataset roll --concurrency 8`
    (or similar) is ready to run; realistic cost is ~4 days continuous,
    CDN-bound. **Do not start it without being asked.**
14. ~~Resume the ASD exhaustive sweep~~ — **done, 2026-09-04.** Resumed
    per explicit user instruction (ahead of items 11-12 being fully
    settled — user's call, not this project's usual ordering), ran to
    completion: 60,923/60,923 booths, 0 real failures statewide. Found and
    fixed a real script bug along the way (bucket-fetch cache poisoning,
    `ba80c42cb04`). See the dedicated section above for full detail.
15. Publish/republish loop for ASD data going forward — no auto-publish
    script written yet. Low priority: ASD extraction is a one-shot, already-
    finished pass; revisit only if ECI revises ASD reports in place (untested
    — see `OBSERVATIONS-ASD.md` §8).
16. Now that a real overlap exists (item 6), consider whether the 3,191
    known collision EPICs deserve their own spot-check pass through the
    live site's actual verdict-3 UI path once picked up cold — not done
    this session, just noting the data now exists to make that check
    meaningful rather than theoretical.

### 8-AC deep confirmation pass applied; 50k-sample live-check false alarm closed — 2026-09-04

Picked up two loose ends left by the previous session (item 11's ongoing
work), both now resolved:

1. **The 50k-sample live-verification's one open "wrong location" flag was
   a false alarm in the checker, not a live-deploy bug.** Re-ran
   `verify-confirmed-rows-live.mjs` (written last session, never re-run
   after its first failing result) and got the same single flag as before:
   AC174/part424 — corrected serial713's new EPIC (`HGB3064268`) resolves
   on the live site to serial712, not 713. Root cause: serial712's own
   *un*corrected, genuinely-printed EPIC is verbatim `HGB3064268` — a
   pre-existing duplicate the correction collided into. The commit that
   applied the 288 corrections (`58d75e5789c`) already documented this
   exact case as "correctly resolved via the existing first-processed-wins
   policy" — i.e., already known-benign, just not reflected in the
   checker's classification logic, which only recognized the "hit not
   found at all" shape of a benign duplicate, not "hit found but under the
   other duplicate's serial." Fixed the classification (same-part,
   different-serial hits now also count as benign) and re-ran: **CLEAN,
   287 found + 1 known-benign duplicate, 0 real issues, 300/300 untouched
   buckets spot-checked clean.** Pushed as `77c758b2ba2`.
2. **8-AC deep confirmation pass — reviewed, applied, verified.** Last
   session added `--only-acs` to `measure_batching_error.py` and ran a
   deeper per-AC sample (25 cards/part across every part) on 8 ACs already
   flagged by broader sampling: 6, 20, 115, 145, 191, 207, 215, 219. That
   run finished unattended (`cache/ocr-batching-check-deep8-summary.json`,
   211 silent-mismatch candidates) with nobody having reviewed the crops
   yet. Built composite review sheets
   (`build_candidate_review_sheets.py`, 36 sheets) and manually pixel-
   reviewed **all 211** against their crops directly (not sampled — every
   one, per this bug's own standing rule that a clean-looking statistical
   pattern still needs individual verification; see AC190 GYV/GLV above
   for why that rule exists).

   **Result: every one of the 8 ACs turned out to be a single clean,
   consistent dominant prefix** — AC6→`ZTO`, AC20→`IYP`, AC115→`IOP`,
   AC145→`IUO`, AC191→`AOV`, AC207→`UII`, AC215→`IQG`, AC219→`AOH` — with
   **one unrelated outlier** (AC215/part46/serial481: prefix `GGB`, a
   pure digit-order scramble between batched/isolated readings, unrelated
   to the letter-confusion cluster; the published value was already
   correct there, no fix needed). Cross-checked every derived correction
   against whichever of batched/isolated actually shared the crop's digit
   suffix (7 candidates had batched/isolated digit suffixes that
   disagreed with each other — each of those 7 re-checked individually
   against its own crop rather than assumed).

   Of 211 candidates: **130 genuine misreads** (confirmed corrections)
   and **81 false positives** (batched/published was already correct;
   isolated was the false lead — consistent with this bug's known
   false-positive rate on the isolation side). Applied via
   `fix-confirmed-rows.mjs`, dry-run verified first (0 skipped, 0
   duplicate collisions), 260 bucket files touched across 8 ACs. All 211
   individual manual-review verdicts logged to `test-logs/test-log.jsonl`
   under layer `ocr-batching-check-manual-review-deep8` (via a small new
   `scripts/log-deep8-review.mjs`, same shape as the 10k pass's
   `-manual-review-10k` entries). Pushed as `6d383361d3f`.

   **These 8 ACs are now done** — no longer part of item 11's unmeasured
   scope. The two harder categories item 11 already identified (messy
   multi-prefix clusters needing per-pair verification like this one just
   got; genuine digit-to-digit misreads with no consensus-based fix) still
   apply to the rest of the state — this pass narrowed the list, it didn't
   close item 11 out entirely. Live-site verification of these 130
   corrections still needs to be run once the Pages deploy for
   `6d383361d3f` finishes (in progress as of this write-up) —
   `node scripts/verify-confirmed-rows-live.mjs cache/confirmed-corrections-deep8.json`
   (note: `cache/` is gitignored, so that exact file only exists on the
   machine that ran this session — regenerate from
   `cache/silent-candidates-deep8-reviewed.json`'s `CONFIRMED` entries if
   it's gone, same shape as the 50k pass's corrections file).

   **Update, same session: ran once the deploy finished — CLEAN.** All 130
   corrections live and correct (130/130 old EPICs gone, 130/130 new EPICs
   found at the right ac/part/serial, 0 duplicate-collision anomalies this
   time), 300/300 untouched buckets spot-checked clean. This item is now
   fully closed, not just applied.

   Also worth recording since it came up mid-session: **checked whether
   ECI has published Revision 2 of the SIR Draft Roll yet — no.** Probed
   the CDN directly (`.../SIR-DraftRoll-Revision2-KAN-1-WI.pdf` in place
   of the `Revision1` this project's URLs use) across 5 ACs spread across
   the state (1, 50, 100, 150, 161, 224) — all 404, `Revision1` still 200
   for the same parts. The dataset this project scrapes is still current
   against what's actually published; no action needed, just worth
   re-checking periodically since a real Revision 2 would obsolete
   everything scraped so far.

### ASD exhaustive sweep resumed; a real script bug found and fixed — 2026-09-04

Resumed `14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs --dataset asd` (item 14) from its
1,661/60,923 pause point, per explicit user instruction. Found and fixed a
real correctness bug in the script itself while it ran: `fetchBucket()`
cached a transient network failure as a permanent `null` for that hash
prefix (`.catch(() => null)`, then `bucketCache.set`), so one CDN blip
meant every later EPIC hashing to the same bucket silently read as
"missing from the live site" for the rest of the run — a false site-layer
fail indistinguishable from a real one. Caught by 6 fails landing in the
same ~3-second window across unrelated ACs (6, 8, 11, 39, 127, 176); all 6
individually re-verified live and correct. Fixed to match
`verifyBoothAgainstPdf`'s existing retry pattern — 3 attempts with
backoff, only caching on success — committed as `ba80c42cb04`. Sweep
restarted clean (done-ledger meant zero lost progress) and ran the rest of
the way with 0 further script-caused false alarms.

One more fail surfaced (`RSG4075990`, ac179/part110/serial66) that turned
out to be a **genuine duplicate EPIC in the raw published ASD data**, not
a bug: the same EPIC, name, and relative-name are printed twice by ECI —
once at ac179/part110/serial66, once at ac168/part161/serial307 — and the
live site's existing first-processed-wins policy (already documented in
the 50k live-check section above) keeps only the ac168 copy. Confirmed
directly against `cache/asd-rows/168.jsonl` and `179.jsonl`. Not fixed,
because there is nothing to fix — this is the same known-benign
duplicate-handling shape, just a new instance of it, this time spanning
two different ACs rather than two parts within one.

**Completed the same session: 60,923/60,923 ASD booths swept, 0 real
site-layer or PDF-layer failures statewide.** The only 8 fails logged
across the entire run were the 7 pre-fix false alarms above and the one
confirmed-benign cross-AC duplicate — every single one individually
accounted for, none left unexplained. This closes item 14.

### Roll dataset spot-check — 200-booth random sample, clean

Prompted by the same "check for data updates" request, and since the roll
dataset's own full extraction is separately confirmed complete (all
224 ACs, 60,923/60,923 parts in `cache/done/`, matching the CEO's own
polling-station count), ran a bounded random sample rather than the full
~4-day statewide sweep (item 13, still deliberately not started without
being asked): `node scripts/14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs --dataset roll --limit
200 --concurrency 8`. Also directly re-fetched AC196/part227, the exact
file the original CDN discovery hashed — **still byte-identical**, same
SHA-256 (`01e9555e…c402699e`), same 10,198,409 bytes, weeks later.

**Result: 200/200 booths, 0 site-layer fails, 1 PDF-layer fail — and that
one fail is a false alarm, pixel-verified.** AC161/part89/serial16 came
back "EPIC not found on re-read" because a *fresh* full-part OCR pass
misread the card as `WZZ3105590`; cropped and visually inspected the
actual card image directly (not just re-OCR'd again) and it unambiguously
reads `WZU3105590` — matching the already-published value exactly. This
is the same OCR-batching noise item 11 already documents at length (a
second automated pass disagreeing with a correctly-published first pass),
now caught going the *opposite* direction from every prior instance: here
the fresh re-read was the wrong one, not the cached data. No fix needed;
no real defect found in the 200-booth sample.

**Bottom line on "is there a data update": no, on either dataset.** No
Revision 2, no silent Revision-1 content change (byte-identical hash), no
ASD drift (0/60,923 real fails, full statewide sweep), no roll drift found
in a 200-booth statewide sample plus the one specific file the whole
project's CDN-legitimacy finding rests on.

### CEO press note, 04.09.2026 — not a Revision 2, but confirms project numbers and a hard deadline

The CEO's office posted a routine SIR-2026 status press note (via
`x.com/ceo_karnataka`, PDF at
`ceo.karnataka.gov.in/uploads/PRESS NOTE 04-09-2026.pdf`). Read in full
(21 pages). **Not a new roll publication** — it's notice-generation/
delivery progress, Form 6/6A/7/8 guidance, nothing that changes what this
project scrapes. Worth recording three things from it that are not
derivable from this repo:

1. **Independent confirmation of this project's part count.** Annexure-2
   states **60,923 polling stations statewide**, matching exactly what
   `1-discover.mjs`'s CDN probing already found and what the ASD
   exhaustive sweep (above) just finished checking against.
2. **Official explanation for the ABSENT/SHIFTED/DUPLICATE reason codes**
   already in the ASD dataset: item 8 of the note states plainly that "due
   to rationalisation of polling stations and re-serialisation of
   electors, the Part Number and Serial Number may have changed" — i.e.
   this is by design on ECI's side, not a data-quality problem, matching
   this project's own findings.
3. **A hard deadline that will eventually obsolete the current dataset**:
   the claims/objections window closes 23.09.2026, and the **Final
   Electoral Roll will be published 27.10.2026**. Everything this project
   has scraped is the *Draft* Roll; once the Final Roll ships, revisit
   whether it needs to be scraped as a distinct, newer dataset. Total
   statewide electors as of 04.09.2026: 4,46,38,124 (district breakdown in
   the note's Annexure-1), for whatever future cross-check that's worth.

## 11. Third dataset — CEO "notices issued" search — 2026-09-06, built, data ~24% loaded, currently paused

User spotted `https://ceo.karnataka.gov.in/notices_issued.html` — the CEO's
office started publishing lists of electors issued a discrepancy or
no-mapping notice (name, EPIC, reason) and asked for it to be added as a
third searchable dataset, "without disturbing the current data." Committed
as `a272f9101ab`.

**Not on ECI's CDN, no captcha, no login — but not clean either.** The page
links to 34 independently-uploaded Google Drive folders, one per district,
each hand-populated by that district's own office. Investigated before
building anything (see the questions asked and answered mid-session):

- **Folder depth varies by district** — BBMP Central nests through an extra
  `"{ac}-{name}"` folder before a `"... No Mapping and Discrepancies"`
  subfolder; Kodagu goes straight to `"{ac} Notice Issued List"`. A naive
  fixed-depth crawl would miss whichever shape it didn't expect.
- **At least 3 filename conventions** coexist:
  `discrepency_2026_s10_SR_FORM_{ac}_discrepency_elector_report_ac{ac}_part{N}.pdf`
  (the common case), `S10_{ac}_{part}_{booth name}_{date}.pdf` (BBMP
  Central's AC163), and Koppal publishes `.zip`/`.rar` archives instead of
  PDFs at all (not yet handled — flagged, not silently dropped, see below).
- **At least 2 PDF content templates** — one with a clean text header
  (`AC No and Name: ...` / `Part No and Name: ...`) and a named
  `Reason for discrepancy` column; the other (AC163 only, so far) has no
  header at all and a different column set (`Mapping Category`, `Relative
  Details`, `DOB/Age`, `Photo Uploaded`) — AC/part must come from the
  filename or folder name instead.
- A first, naive filename-pattern-only discovery pass **silently missed
  AC163 entirely and 11 of Belgaum's 18 ACs** — not because they were
  empty, but because their files didn't match the one pattern assumed.
  Rebuilt to catch every `.pdf` regardless of name before this shipped —
  see `17-discover-notices.mjs`'s own header comment for why identifying
  AC/part is deferred entirely to extraction (reading the PDF's own text is
  more reliable than guessing from whichever convention that office used).

User picked **staged rollout** over full upfront characterization, narrow
single-template scope, or pausing — ship whatever parses cleanly now,
labelled as partial, expand template coverage later (same shape as this
project's own district-by-district rollout history).

**Pipeline built**: `scripts/lib/gdrive.mjs` (unauthenticated folder
listing via Drive's `embeddedfolderview` endpoint — no API key, no
OAuth — plus direct file download); `17-discover-notices.mjs` (generic
recursive crawl, found **42,699 PDFs across 32 of 34 districts** —
Davanagere's linked folder is genuinely empty, Koppal uses zip/rar, both
flagged for later, not retried blindly); `scripts/ocr/notices_parser.py`
(anchor-based row parser — anchors on the `(int, int, EPIC)` triple every
row starts with, since cell text wraps across PDF text-extraction lines
unpredictably and a fixed column-width assumption breaks); `18-extract-notices.py`
(fetch + parse + write to `cache/notices-rows/<ac>.jsonl`, resumable by
Drive file ID since AC/part isn't known until a file is actually read);
`19-build-notices-data.mjs` (hash-bucketed exactly like the roll/ASD trees,
built to `docs/data-notices` — sibling of `docs/data`, never a child, same
reasoning as `10-build-asd-data.mjs`'s own comment on why that placement is
load-bearing). UI wired into `docs/app.js`/`index.html`/`styles.css`: a
notices hit renders as an additional callout appended to whatever roll/ASD
verdict already applies, in both languages — deliberately **never its own
verdict, and never shown at all on a miss**, since this dataset's coverage
cannot yet back a trustworthy negative the way the roll's 99% rule or ASD's
404-means-empty convention can.

**Two real bugs found and fixed while running this, both worth remembering:**

1. **A silent full-stall with no exception** — the first full-scale
   extraction attempt (32,250 files queued) stopped making any progress at
   all with nothing in the log and no crash. Root cause not fully confirmed
   but consistent with a PyMuPDF hang on some adversarial PDF (see
   `9-extract-asd.py`'s own note that PyMuPDF is not thread-safe and has
   been unstable "the hard way" before) — one giant `ProcessPoolExecutor`
   submitted up front has no way to recover from that short of killing the
   whole process by hand. Fixed by processing in batches of 300 with a
   fresh pool per batch and a hard 600s per-batch timeout that force-shuts
   the pool (`wait=False, cancel_futures=True`) rather than hanging on
   graceful shutdown — bounds the blast radius of a repeat to one batch
   instead of the entire remaining run.
2. **Google Drive's anonymous-download quota** — after downloading roughly
   10,000 files via `uc?export=download` in one run, every further request,
   even for a completely fresh file never touched before, started silently
   200-ing with an HTML sign-in redirect (`ServiceLogin`) instead of the
   PDF — confirmed directly by testing an untouched file in isolation, not
   assumed. Not fixable without a real Google login, which was deliberately
   not added (same reasoning as this project's standing captcha rule: don't
   reach for credentials/bypasses when the honest answer is "wait").
   `fetch()` now detects the sign-in-wall pattern on the first response (no
   wasted retries) and the whole run stops immediately with a clear
   message instead of grinding through the remaining queue at ~19s/file of
   pure retry-and-fail. **Rerun `python scripts/18-extract-notices.py
   --workers 8` later** once the block has had time to cool down (duration
   not measured — try after a few hours); it resumes from
   `cache/notices-done.txt` automatically, currently at 10,449/42,699.

**Also mid-session: a live resource-contention lesson.** Running the roll
exhaustive sweep (item 13, resumed this session per explicit request —
"4 day exhaustive sweep during night") concurrently with the
notices extraction's 8 workers produced a real spike in the sweep's own
fail count (67 site fails + 69 pdf fails in 700 booths, vs. 0 across the
entire prior ASD sweep) and a throughput collapse to 1.4 booths/min, with
the sweep's own `fetchBucket` retries (from the fix earlier this session,
`ba80c42cb04`) visibly exhausting against a live site that normally answers
instantly. Pausing the notices extraction stopped new fails from
accumulating immediately. Not root-caused with certainty (GitHub Pages
rate-limiting one very busy client is also plausible, not just local
network saturation), but the practical lesson either way: **do not run the
roll sweep and the notices extraction at full worker counts at the same
time on this machine** — pick one as the active job. User's explicit
instruction mid-session was to pause the sweep and prioritize notices
instead; both are cleanly paused as of this write-up (sweep at 931/60,923,
notices at 10,449/42,699), each resumable independently with zero lost
progress via their own done-ledgers.

**To resume, once you know which one you want running:**
```
node scripts/14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs --dataset roll --concurrency 8    # roll sweep, item 13
python scripts/18-extract-notices.py --workers 8                       # notices extraction
```
Do not run both at once, per the above. Once notices extraction finishes,
run `node scripts/19-build-notices-data.mjs` to actually publish it to
`docs/data-notices` — the UI code is already live, it just has no data
behind it yet.

### Update, same day — moved to GitHub Actions, statewide data now live

User's own prior project, `karnataka-asddo-dashboard`, had already solved
this exact problem (per-district Google Drive PDFs, Drive's own
throttling) — pointed to it as a reference rather than reinventing.
Confirmed empirically first, not assumed: a one-off diagnostic workflow
(`test-drive-access.yml`, deleted after use) showed 5/5 files that were
blocked on the local machine succeeded immediately from a fresh Actions
runner IP. Built `.github/workflows/notices-import.yml` as a discover ->
extract-matrix -> build pipeline modelled directly on that reference
project's `import.yml`, at `max-parallel: 6` (the same number they settled
on after finding higher values "trade throughput for throttling and
403s") — ported `plan-matrix.mjs` and `guard-district-coverage.mjs` from
there too (`scripts/plan-notices-matrix.mjs`,
`scripts/guard-notices-coverage.mjs`).

**Three real bugs found by actually running it, none of them visible from
reading the code beforehand:**

1. **`19-build-notices-data.mjs` needed `cache/manifest.json`**, which is
   gitignored and does not exist on a fresh runner. Re-running the roll's
   own `1-discover.mjs` there to regenerate it was considered and
   rejected — it hits ECI's CDN with ~2,700 HEAD requests for data that
   never changes, and risks the exact "runner kept returning 406" block
   this file's own section 4b documents for a different pipeline.
   Fixed with a small committed static seed, `seed/ac-metadata.json`
   (35 KB — just acNumber/name/nameKn/district/partCount, regenerate from
   `cache/manifest.json` if it ever goes stale), mirroring the reference
   project's own `seed/manifest.json.gz` fallback pattern. Also needed a
   `!docs/data-notices/` gitignore exception — the `data-*/` glob was
   silently swallowing the very thing the build job commits.
2. **An artifact-path bug silently discarded every extracted row.**
   `upload-artifact` computes its archive root as the common ancestor of
   every path it is given; bundling `cache/notices-rows/*.jsonl` with the
   separate `cache/notices-unresolved.jsonl` in one upload made that
   ancestor `cache/`, so on download the real row files landed at
   `cache/notices-rows/notices-rows/*.jsonl` — one level deeper than the
   build job's flat glob expects. A run that logged "58884 rows written"
   for Kodagu alone still published "0 rows across 0 constituencies."
   Fixed by giving the rows and the unresolved log separate, single-root
   uploads.
3. **A silent-narrowing bug in discovery itself.** Belgaum, Bellary and
   Tumkur all came back with 0 PDFs found in the first full statewide run,
   with no error logged at all — but all three had real files (1,456,
   703, 866 respectively) confirmed in an earlier, uncontended local run.
   `embeddedfolderview` returning HTTP 200 with a genuinely empty parse
   under load is indistinguishable, to the old code, from a real empty
   folder like Davanagere's. This is exactly the kind of failure
   `karnataka-asddo-dashboard`'s own history warns about (a district
   present at the source but missing from the import, with nothing
   flagging it) — fixed by having `crawlDistrict` re-check up to twice,
   with a delay, before accepting a 0-file result as final.

**A fourth, different thing was found, not a bug — a real per-runner
download quota.** One Actions job (Tumkur, on its second attempt) hit the
exact same Drive sign-in wall the local machine hit after ~10,000
downloads — proof that spreading the pull across many runner IPs raises
the ceiling a lot, but does not make it infinite. Handled gracefully
already (the `DriveRateLimited` fast-stop from earlier the same day) —
that job's files just stay outstanding for a future run.

**Two districts are not a throttling problem at all.** Hassan and
Chitradurga's Drive folders returned HTTP 401 across three consecutive
full statewide re-runs, on `embeddedfolderview` from many different
Actions runner IPs — and, confirmed directly, from the local machine too
(a completely fresh IP with zero download history that day). A stable 401
from every source tested is a genuine access/permissions problem with
those two specific folders, not rate-limiting, and no amount of retrying
or IP diversity will fix it. Alongside Davanagere (folder genuinely empty)
and Koppal (publishes `.zip`/`.rar` instead of PDFs), this is now a
4-district standing gap — flagged, not silently missing, and worth an
occasional manual re-check in case the source office fixes the sharing
setting, but not worth further automated retries.

**State as of this write-up: 154 constituencies, 3,814,935 rows, live in
`docs/data-notices` on `main`.** Three full statewide re-runs
(`gh workflow run notices-import.yml`) grew this from 144 -> 149 -> 154
constituencies with zero regressions each time — the collapse guard
(`guard-notices-coverage.mjs`) never needed to actually block a publish in
practice, but the mechanism was exercised for real (a run's build job
compares against the live-checked-out `docs/data-notices/manifest.json`
before every rebuild). Re-running the workflow again may recover a little
more (whichever districts get an unlucky IP this time might not next
time) but Hassan/Chitradurga will not resolve without the source fixing
their sharing settings, and Davanagere/Koppal need a different format
handled entirely (zip/rar extraction, or accepting Davanagere has nothing
to offer).

### Live verification, actually done — 2026-09-07

User asked directly whether the live UI was tested and whether the three
datasets were checked for collisions. Neither had actually been done yet
at that point — building and publishing the pipeline is not the same
thing as verifying the deployed result, and this project's own standing
rule is not to claim the second without doing it. Done properly:

- Confirmed the deployed `app.js` and `config.js` are byte-identical to
  current source (diff after normalizing CRLF/LF) — not a stale Pages
  cache.
- Found a real overlap case in production data: `REJ0650416` is on both
  the roll (AC154/part101/serial19) and notices ("Self Name Mismatch",
  same booth) datasets. Traced `handleEpic()`'s exact logic against it:
  `rollHit` truthy -> renders the found-on-roll verdict, `noticesExtra`
  truthy -> appended as the additional callout. No browser tool is
  available in this environment, so this is the same fetch-based
  verification method the project has always used for "live" checks
  (`verify-confirmed-rows-live.mjs` etc.), not a screenshot — traced
  against the real deployed code and real production data, not asserted.
- Isolation confirmed both directions: `AAH4480430` (roll-only) is absent
  from ASD and notices; `REJ0650416` (the genuine overlap above) is
  correctly present in both roll and notices and absent from ASD. No
  cross-contamination.

**Found in the process, not asked for: the site is now ~1.59 GB
total** (`data-asd` 1,136 MB + `data-notices` 286 MB + `data` 166 MB),
over GitHub Pages' documented 1 GB cap. Confirmed still serving correctly
live regardless (Pages' "deploy from a branch" mode has no build step to
fail, unlike a Jekyll site). `config.js`'s own comment and
`scripts/4-upload-r2.mjs` already anticipated exactly this — a Cloudflare
R2 migration path, built and sitting unused "until the scope grows"
(section 4b). It has now grown past 1 GB. **User's explicit call: leave
it as-is for now**, not a decision to revisit without being asked again.

### Source PDF links + two more real bugs found the same way — 2026-09-07

User asked for a source-PDF link on notices results (matching the
roll/ASD pattern) and reported not seeing it live. Investigating that
report — not just the missing link, but the actual live data behind
it — surfaced two unrelated, real bugs, exactly the way this project's
best findings have kept coming from actually checking rather than
inspecting code:

1. **Header text bleeding into reason/name fields at page breaks.**
   `notices_parser.py`'s Template A/B row parsers anchor on the next
   `(int, int, EPIC)` triple to know where a row ends — but the PDF table
   header repeats on every new page mid-document, and header tokens don't
   match that anchor shape, so they were silently swallowed into whichever
   field was being consumed when the page turned. Confirmed directly:
   AC121/part4/serial188's `reason` was
   `"Parent Age Difference <15,Parent Name Mismatch S.No Part Serial
   Number EPIC Number Elector Name Age Gender Reason for discrepancy"` —
   the real reason with the next page's entire header appended. Fixed by
   treating each template's own exact header-start token ("S.No" /
   "S.No.") as a hard stop. Affected roughly 1 in every 12-15 rows
   statewide (however many land last on a page) — this is why the fix
   mattered at the dataset level, not just for one row.
2. **The build script had no merge capability, so one flaky district
   blocked every other district's improvement too.** Three Actions runs
   in a row correctly got refused by `guard-notices-coverage.mjs` because
   one unrelated district (Bangalore Rural twice, then a single AC within
   it) came back short — but the *reason* that mattered was that
   `19-build-notices-data.mjs` did a full rebuild from only that run's
   fresh rows every time, with no way to carry forward ACs it did not
   touch. One failure meant "publish nothing," discarding real, safe
   improvements (the source-link field, the header-bleed fix, newly-
   recovered districts) to everything else along with it. Fixed with a
   proper merge build, modelled on `karnataka-asddo-dashboard`'s own
   `3b-merge-build.mjs`: rebuild fresh only for ACs this run produced rows
   for, and read every other AC's already-published records straight out
   of the currently-checked-out `docs/data-notices` to carry forward
   unchanged — falling back to the old fresh-only behavior (with a loud
   warning) only in the rare case the shard depth would change between
   builds, since a bucket record stores a hash suffix, not the EPIC, so it
   cannot be rehashed into a different-depth prefix without the original.
   Verified locally end-to-end before trusting it in production: took the
   real published data, built with a deliberately tiny fresh sample for
   one AC, and confirmed the touched AC changed, every untouched AC
   matched byte-for-byte, and the collapse guard still correctly fires on
   a *touched* AC that comes back smaller.

**Immediate result**: the very next run after the merge fix landed
published cleanly — **189 constituencies, 4,032,576 rows** (up from 154),
31 of 34 districts covered (up from a prior best of 29). Both Davanagere
and Koppal — previously always empty/zip-rar, a standing gap noted
earlier the same day — now have real content: the source offices
apparently added PDFs there sometime today. Verified live, not assumed:
`YNX3762564` (AC121/part4/serial188, the case that surfaced bug #1) now
resolves with a clean `reason` field and a `fileId` that links to a
Drive URL confirmed to return 200.

**Correction to the earlier same-day section**: Hassan actually recovered
and is now published (confirmed by checking the live manifest's district
list directly, not assumed from an old log) — the "Hassan and
Chitradurga" pairing noted earlier is now just **Chitradurga and
Vijayapura**, verified as the only 2 of 34 districts absent from the
32-district published set (34 minus 32 = 2, checked by exact normalized
name match, not eyeballed — several published names use slightly
different spelling than the source list, e.g. "CHIKKMAGALUR" vs
"Chikkamagalur", which a sloppier comparison miscounted as missing
too). Both Chitradurga and Vijayapura returned 401 on Drive's folder
listing across multiple checks earlier the same day — worth re-checking
whether Vijayapura clears the same way Hassan just did on a future
re-run, since it was never confirmed as a persistent (any-IP) 401 the way
Chitradurga specifically was. Everything else should keep recovering
incrementally on future re-runs now that the merge build means a re-run
costs nothing even for districts that already succeeded.

### Tumkur re-extracted; Bangalore Rural's instability finally explained — 2026-09-07 evening

User asked to re-run Tumkur and Bangalore Rural specifically (run
`34141878270`, `-f districts="Tumkur,Bangalore Rural" -f
workers_per_job=6`). Outcome:

- **Tumkur**: 1,971 PDFs found and extracted cleanly, merged in. Guard
  passed (no AC below 70%, state total above 90% of last build), 189
  constituencies still represented, **4,032,576 rows** published (same
  total as before — expected, since merge-build only rewrites the ACs a
  run actually touched; commit `67c642403` changed exactly 25 bucket
  files, consistent with Tumkur's own AC set and nothing else).
- **Bangalore Rural**: excluded from the extract matrix entirely — the
  discover job's retry-on-empty logic (added earlier this session) fired
  twice and still got 0 PDFs both times:
  ```
  Bangalore Rural: came back empty, re-checking (attempt 2)...
  Bangalore Rural: came back empty, re-checking (attempt 3)...
  Bangalore Rural: 0 PDF(s) found
  ```

**Root cause chased down directly, not assumed.** Fetched Bangalore
Rural's top-level Drive folder (`1bzoI2GxURGOtLvqVc8o0jAyoNvJ0Zhgw`) by
hand: still the correct folder (`<title>SIR - Bangalore Rural List of
persons whom notices have been issued</title>`), but its only child is a
folder literally named "Untitled folder"
(`1XkB9TmUlaxqldvD2znUT-slrpJ1l0oAN`). Fetched that subfolder's own
listing directly and it is **genuinely, currently empty** — confirmed by
the raw HTML: `<div class="flip-entries"></div>` with zero child
elements, not a parse failure or a rate-limit page.

This is a **different failure shape** from the four confirmed-permanent
gaps (Belgaum, Vijayanagara, Bellary, Raichur — folders that were never
populated at all). Bangalore Rural's own discovery history this session
went **274 -> 561 -> 0** files across three separate checks, i.e. it had
real content twice before going empty. Read together with today's
"Untitled folder" name and its emptiness, the most likely explanation is
the district office is mid-reorganization (renaming/moving the folder,
temporarily emptying it in the process) rather than a pipeline bug on our
side — the crawler and the retry-on-empty logic both behaved correctly
against what Drive is actually serving right now. **Recommend**: leave
Bangalore Rural out of the next few runs and re-check in a few days
rather than retrying immediately, since nothing will change until the
source folder is repopulated. Not marked as a fifth permanent gap
alongside Belgaum/Vijayanagara/Bellary/Raichur — those are stable-empty,
this one is actively changing.

### Full statewide re-run — Belgaum/Bellary/Raichur/Vijayanagara were
### NOT permanent gaps after all — 2026-09-08

User asked for a manual AC-level spot check on Hassan first (see below),
then a full 34-district re-run, with a live Drive presence check before
triggering it rather than discovering failures only after a 45-minute
run.

**Pre-check (direct `listFolder` against all 34 district root folders,
concurrency 3):** 31 reachable, 3 failed — Chitradurga (401), Shimoga
(401), Vijayapura (404). Retried each of the 3 individually with spacing
to rule out concurrency-induced rate-limiting: all three failed again,
confirming genuine persistent failures, not transient throttling.
**Shimoga is a new failure** — it was not in the previously-documented
gap list (only Chitradurga and Vijayapura were known-bad as of the prior
session). Vijayapura's 404 (vs. 401 for the other two) is a different
failure mode — a 404 on `embeddedfolderview` suggests the folder ID
itself may no longer resolve, not just a listing-endpoint throttle.

**Full run result** (workflow `34195384162`, all districts,
`workers_per_job=6`): 30 of 34 districts made it into the extract matrix
(Chitradurga/Shimoga/Vijayapura errored at discovery, Bangalore Rural
silently returned 0 files as already documented above). Guard passed —
**4,076,413 rows across 193 constituencies** (up from 4,032,576 / 189),
185 constituencies got fresh rows this run, 8 untouched ACs (61,454 rows)
carried forward unchanged. Commit `6bb9c39ef`, pushed on attempt 1.

**The 8 untouched ACs are exactly Shimoga's 7 ACs (111-117) plus
Bangalore Rural's Devanahalli (AC179)** — confirmed by cross-referencing
the roll manifest's district lists, not assumed. This means today's new
Shimoga failure cost nothing: its data from an earlier successful run
was preserved byte-for-byte by the merge build, exactly as designed.

**The real finding**: computed the exact 31-AC gap in the freshly
published manifest (224 total ACs minus 193 represented) and mapped each
missing AC number back to its district via the roll manifest:

- Chitradurga: 6/6 ACs missing (97,98,99,100,101,102) — full district,
  consistent with the confirmed 401.
- Vijayapura (source data still labels it "Bijapur"): 8/8 ACs missing
  (26-33) — full district, consistent with the confirmed 404.
- Bangalore Rural: 3/4 ACs missing (178,180,181); Devanahalli (179)
  present from the earlier preserved run.
- **Belgaum: only 3 ACs missing (4,6,13) out of 18.** Previously
  documented as one of four "confirmed-permanent gap districts" — this
  run's discovery found 2,955 PDFs there.
- **Bellary: only 2 ACs missing (93,95) out of 6** (Bellary discovery:
  656 PDFs).
- **Raichur: only 2 ACs missing (53,55) out of 6** (812 PDFs).
- **Vijayanagara: only 4 ACs missing (88,89,90,104) out of 7** (163
  PDFs).
- Single stray ACs elsewhere: Davanagere (110), Chikkamagalur (126),
  Tumkur (131) — one AC each, not a district-level pattern.

**Correction to the earlier "confirmed-permanent gap" framing**:
Belgaum/Bellary/Raichur/Vijayanagara were never actually permanent — the
prior session's characterization was based on 0-PDF results at the time,
but this run found real, substantial PDF counts for all four (hundreds
each). Most of each district is now published; only a handful of ACs
per district remain outstanding, the same partial-coverage pattern as
everywhere else rather than a special never-populated category. The only
two districts still fully, completely dark are **Chitradurga** (401) and
**Vijayapura** (404) — Vijayapura's 404 in particular is worth treating
differently from a throttle-driven 401 on a future retry, since a 404
suggests the folder ID itself needs re-verifying against
`ceo.karnataka.gov.in/notices_issued.html` rather than just trying again
later.

## 12. Two more real gaps found by manual scouting — 2026-09-09/10

User's instruction going forward for the notices dataset: before triggering
an import run, manually scout suspicious/low-coverage districts first
(fresh Drive crawl, check for hidden content) to confirm a shortfall is
genuine, *then* trigger. Two real, different bugs were found this way —
worth internalizing both patterns since a plain PDF-count comparison alone
would have kept missing them.

**Bug 1 — zip archives are invisible to a PDF-only file filter.**
`17-discover-notices.mjs` only ever matched `/\.pdf$/i`, so a folder whose
content was a single `.zip` looked completely, silently empty — exactly the
Davanagere-style "silent narrowing" this dataset has hit before, just one
file extension over. Found by listing a "confirmed empty" Vijayanagara AC
folder's raw entries with no extension filter at all: 4 of its 5 ACs
(Hadagali, Hagaribommanahalli, Vijayanagara-town, Harapanahalli) each hold
exactly one zip of per-part PDFs (`Discrepancies.zip` etc.), not zero files.
**Fixed**: `17-discover-notices.mjs` now also records `.zip` files (tagged
`kind: 'zip'`) and reports (not silently drops) any `.rar`/`.7z` found —
Ramanagara has exactly one, deliberately not extracted (no Python stdlib
support, not worth a new system dependency for one file statewide).
`18-extract-notices.py` unzips a zip job in memory and runs every member
through the existing `read_notices_pdf` unchanged — the PDFs inside are
plain Template A content, confirmed directly. Verified against all 4 real
archives before trusting it (796/796 members resolved, 0 errors, 0
unresolved), then again in production the same way (167 job → 959 Template-A
members, 0 unresolved). Vijayanagara went from 1/5 ACs (49.2%) to **5/5 ACs,
71.2%** in one run. **Any future "this folder is genuinely empty" finding
should list raw entries with no extension filter before concluding that —
this is the second time a filtered listing has been the actual bug, not the
data.**

**Bug 2 — a 404 on a hand-transcribed folder ID can mean the link moved, not
that the source is down.** Vijayapura's ID
(`1E0uH1P8FJ9z5L7OW0PO5dK4ikSczWKpX`) 404'd on every check across several
days, including a direct hit on Google's own `drive.google.com/drive/folders/`
URL — read as a genuine external outage nothing on our side could fix
(consistent with this project's general experience that a 404 means "really
gone" the way it does for the ECI CDN). **It was not an outage — the CEO's
own page had simply pointed the link at a new folder ID**
(`1grogYu5gO67FeRWfH6RrNix374awLAgA`), something re-scraping
`ceo.karnataka.gov.in/notices_issued.html` directly would have caught
immediately rather than re-testing the same stale ID over and over. The new
ID resolves cleanly: 1,021 real PDFs across all 8 ACs, one parsed directly
to confirm (Template A, same as everywhere else). Fixed by updating
`DISTRICT_FOLDERS` in `17-discover-notices.mjs`. **A full re-audit of all 34
districts' IDs against a fresh scrape of the CEO page found no other
drift** — this was specific to Vijayapura, not a systemic problem, but the
`DISTRICT_FOLDERS` map is a static, hand-transcribed snapshot with no
mechanism to detect a future link move on its own. If a district ever goes
back to a clean, repeatable 404 (not a 401 throttle) on both `embeddedfolderview`
*and* the plain `drive/folders/` URL, re-scrape the CEO page for that
district's current link before concluding the source is unavailable — this
exact advice was already written in section 11 above (following the
2026-09-08 run) and sat unactioned for two days before someone asked "is it
really failing?" a second time. Don't wait for that prompt next time.

Both fixes triggered their own import run each; state as of this write-up:
statewide notices coverage climbing past the pre-fix 96.1%-of-CEO-total
figure as both districts' real content lands.

### CEO press note, 11.09.2026 — comparison figures refreshed; a new deadline recorded

Spotted via `x.com/ceo_karnataka`, same channel as the 04.09.2026 note
this project already tracked. PDF at
`ceo.karnataka.gov.in/uploads/PRESS NOTE-11.09.2026.pdf`. This is the
weekly-ish cadence this note is published on — worth re-checking that
account periodically rather than assuming a one-time fetch stays current;
the 04.09 figures baked into `app.js` had gone a week stale by the time
this one surfaced.

Updated `CEO_OFFICIAL_ELECTORS` and `CEO_OFFICIAL_NOTICES` (and their date
strings, both languages, plus the footer's press-note link) to this
note's Annexure-1 and Annexure-2. Both new maps' sums verified to match
the note's own printed statewide totals exactly before committing —
44,658,413 electors (up 20,289 from 04.09's 44,638,124) and 4,381,760
total notices generated (up 615). Per-district deltas are small and
uniform (new Form 6 registrations trickling in), nothing that suggests a
data problem on either side.

**New deadline not previously captured anywhere in this project**: item 2
of the note states last hearing on delivered notices will be conducted
12.10.2026, and last date for disposal of claims and objections is
22.10.2026 — both ahead of the already-known 27.10.2026 Final Roll
publication date. Everything this project scrapes is still the *Draft*
Roll; these are the dates the Draft Roll's discrepancy/notice cycle
actually closes out before the Final Roll supersedes it.

Also same-session: statewide manual crawl (all 34 districts, compared
against the live site fetched fresh, not any cached number — see the
immediately preceding section's own lesson about not trusting a
remembered baseline) found **no new source-side content anywhere**. Every
apparent gap traced to already-understood causes: Chikkaballapur/Tumkur's
known duplicate-file counts, and a new one worth naming for next time —
**Davanagere's raw PDF count (2,384) looks like a huge gap against its
published parts-with-data (763), but isn't**: its Template C content
(section 12 above) is one file per *elector*, not per *part*, so many
files legitimately collapse into few distinct parts, the same shape as
Vijayanagara's zip-expansion false positive. A raw file-count crawl
cannot distinguish this from a real gap on its own — cross-check against
the actual extraction log's `unresolved` count (already 0 for both) before
concluding there's something to chase.

## 13. Resume checklist — written 2026-09-11, ahead of a planned shutdown

User is shutting the machine down for a few hours and asked for this to be
written down first. Everything below is genuinely stopped, not just idle —
confirmed zero Node processes running, git status clean, HEAD `14ba0a65672`
pushed. Nothing is lost either way; both processes are resumed by re-running
the same command, not by anything stateful in this session.

**1. Resume the roll exhaustive sweep (item 13 in this file's own numbering,
unrelated to this section's own "13" — the statewide 1-sample-per-booth
sweep, not the notices pipeline):**

    node scripts/14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs --dataset roll --concurrency 8

Picks up from `cache/exhaustive-done-roll.txt` automatically — 30,666 booths
done as of the pause, 3,800 of this session's 34,079-booth batch checked
(30,879/60,923 overall), **0 site fails, 5 pdf fails**, and every one of
those 5 is the already-understood AC161 WZU-prefix OCR noise (see this
file's own OCR section) — not a real defect, don't re-investigate it fresh.

**2. Restart the test-log auto-committer alongside it**, so the sweep's
results keep getting pushed every 10 minutes without needing to babysit it:

    node scripts/16-commit-test-log.mjs

Both should run detached (`nohup ... & disown` in Git Bash), then verify with
`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name='node.exe'"` that their parent
shell has already exited — a lesson this file's own section 4h documents at
length, still worth re-checking every time rather than assuming.

**3. Before triggering another notices-import workflow run, check for new
source data the right way**: fetch the live manifest fresh
(`https://gouthamganeshm.github.io/Karnataka_Draft_Roll_2026/data-notices/manifest.json?_=<cache-bust>`),
crawl all 34 districts fresh from their roots (never a cached per-AC
subfolder ID — a district office can delete/recreate one under a new ID at
any time, confirmed with Shimoga's AC113), and diff against the live
numbers, not a remembered log line. As of this pause, the last such check
(2026-09-11) found nothing new anywhere — every remaining gap already has a
specific, individually-verified explanation (this file's sections 11 and 12
above have the full list: genuine sparse source uploads in most districts,
duplicate re-uploads in Chikkaballapur/Tumkur/Bidar/Mysore/etc., Vijayapura's
and Vijayanagara's now-fixed gaps, Davanagere's Template-C file-vs-part
ratio). Don't re-trigger the workflow just because time has passed — only
if that fresh crawl actually finds something different.

**4. Nothing else is mid-flight.** The CEO comparison figures in `app.js`
were refreshed to the 11.09.2026 press note this same session and are
already live — no action needed there until the CEO's office posts a newer
one (check `x.com/ceo_karnataka`; roughly weekly cadence observed so far).

**5. One low-priority, not-urgent item worth knowing about**:
`test-logs/test-log.jsonl` is now ~55 MB, past GitHub's 50 MB soft warning
(hard limit is 100 MB). Not blocking anything yet, but if this keeps
growing at the sweep's pace, a rotation or Git LFS decision will eventually
be needed — flagged here so it isn't a surprise later, not asking for
action now.

## 14. Resumed from shutdown + a real Kunigal (AC131) gap found — 2026-09-11

Picked back up per section 13's checklist: confirmed genuinely stopped state
(clean git status, HEAD `2d197824136`, zero `node.exe` processes) before
restarting anything. Resumed both processes detached, verified each rooted
at `nohup.exe` with no further ancestor (the section 4h lesson, re-checked
rather than assumed):

    node scripts/14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs --dataset roll --concurrency 8
    node scripts/16-commit-test-log.mjs

Sweep confirmed picking up exactly where it left off (30,666 already done,
30,257 remaining); committer's first cycle pushed immediately
(196,203 entries).

**Then did checklist item 3 — a fresh statewide Drive crawl** (all 34
districts, `node scripts/17-discover-notices.mjs`, 50,562 PDFs found, 0
district-level failures, safe to run alongside the roll sweep since it hits
Drive, not ECI/GitHub Pages). Compared against the live manifest fetched
fresh (`data-notices/manifest.json`, cache-busted): 220/224 ACs published,
4,330,783 rows. Cross-checked every discrepancy against the crawl rather
than trusting old notes:

- **Chitradurga and Bangalore Rural** (both previously dark — 401 and an
  empty "Untitled folder" respectively, per sections 11-12) are **already
  fully published live** — all their ACs show real row counts. Whatever
  recovered them happened before this session; nothing to do.
- **Belgaum's 3 missing ACs (4, 6, 13)**: confirmed genuinely absent —
  Belgaum's own top-level Drive folder listing has no `04-`, `06-`, or
  `13-` subfolder at all among its 15 present ACs. Real sparse source
  upload, not a crawl or import bug.
- **Tumkur AC131 (Kunigal) — a real, new gap.** Published data shows 0 rows
  for AC131 (every other Tumkur AC has data). The fresh crawl found a
  `131-Kunigal` folder holding **177 real PDFs** — previously this district's
  total was measured at 1,971 files (2026-09-07 targeted re-run); this crawl
  found 2,228, an increase of 257, consistent with this folder being new or
  previously missed. **Worth flagging for whoever picks this up next**: every
  filename inside `131-Kunigal` claims `ac137` (Pavagada, a different AC) —
  a folder/filename mismatch. Not investigated further by hand, since this is
  exactly the situation `18-extract-notices.py` is built for: it trusts the
  PDF's own header text over filename or folder name. If AC131 still shows 0
  rows after the triggered run resolves, that mismatch is the first thing to
  check by actually opening one of these PDFs.

**Triggered the statewide notices-import workflow** (`gh workflow run
"Import notices data"`, run `34627663367`, started 17:26:11Z, user confirmed
explicitly before triggering since it's a shared-state Actions run). `gh` is
authenticated in this session (`gouthamganeshm`, `workflow` scope) — worth
noting since section 5 records an *unrelated* earlier session where `gh` was
not authenticated; that was about the roll pipeline's own (abandoned)
Actions attempt, not this one. Run succeeded in ~56 min, commit `8efda6a88`.

**Resolved, not a gap — the Kunigal folder is a misfiled duplicate.** The
Tumkur extract job log shows all 2,228 files (including the 177 in
`131-Kunigal`) parsed cleanly: **0 unresolved, 0 errors**. But every Tumkur
AC's published row count came back **exactly byte-identical to the pre-run
snapshot** (summed: 93,299 rows both before and after; AC137/Pavagada
unchanged at 6,342; AC131 still absent). Since the files parsed successfully
but produced zero new rows anywhere, the only explanation consistent with
both facts is that the `131-Kunigal` folder holds duplicate copies of
already-published electors (almost certainly Pavagada's, given the
`ac137`-labelled filenames) — real PDFs, correctly read, correctly deduped
by the merge-build, not new source content. This matches the
already-documented "duplicate re-uploads" pattern this district's own
folder has shown before (Chikkaballapur/Tumkur/Bidar/Mysore, per section
13's own recap). **AC131 (Kunigal) itself still has zero genuine source
PDFs anywhere in Drive** — confirmed by this run, not just the raw file
listing. Not a bug, not an import gap; the CEO's Tumkur office has never
uploaded Kunigal-specific notices data. Nothing further to chase here
unless that changes on a future crawl.

**Verified directly against actual file content, not just row-count math —
2026-09-13.** User pushed back on whether this had really been checked
against source data or just inferred. It had only been inferred; checked
properly: downloaded `131-Kunigal`'s own `..._ac137_part10.pdf`
(fileId `1KUw5MFAjc50w3nflLXrnZqq8uMQtss3U`) directly from Drive and read
it with PyMuPDF — its own header text literally says `AC No and Name: 137 -
Pavagada`. Then found `137-Pavagada`'s proper folder holds the identical
count (177 files) including a file of the exact same name, downloaded that
one too (fileId `154r8Bytk_3dzsFpo-J0_jPKdaJZSaL7T`) — **both files are
byte-identical, same SHA-256 `0abfdeaa...b6444b`, same 62,704 bytes, same
extracted text.** Not a one-off coincidence: both folders hold exactly 177
files each. Conclusion now rests on direct evidence (two real downloaded
files, byte-compared) rather than aggregate row-count arithmetic — the
`131-Kunigal` folder is a full duplicate re-upload of `137-Pavagada`'s own
folder under a wrong name, confirmed the same way this project's own
standing practice requires for a claim like this (render/read the actual
source, don't trust the math alone).

**Live-site lookup also verified directly, same session.** Pulled 3 real
EPICs straight out of the downloaded part10 PDF (`TPC4514097`/Swamy.D,
`TPC4338885`/Ranganna M, `TPC4524799`/N Nethravathi) and replicated
`docs/app.js`'s exact lookup (`sha256` → `bucketPath` → binary search)
against the actual deployed `data-notices` tree on
`gouthamganeshm.github.io` — real HTTP fetches, not local data. All three
resolve correctly to AC137/part10/serial 355, 776, 782 with name, age,
gender and reason matching the source PDF exactly, field for field.

One real, minor, cosmetic detail found while doing this: the published
record's `fileId` (the source-PDF link shown to a searcher) is
`1KUw5MFAjc50w3nflLXrnZqq8uMQtss3U` — the **Kunigal-folder copy**, not
`137-Pavagada`'s own file (`154r8Bytk...`). Since the two are byte-identical
this serves correct content either way, but the link a user clicks points
into the misnamed duplicate folder rather than the correctly-named one.
Not worth chasing on its own (cosmetic, zero data impact), but worth
remembering if a future duplicate-resolution pass ever needs a
tie-breaking rule: prefer the canonically-named folder's copy when two
files are byte-identical duplicates, not whichever the merge happened to
keep.

## 15. CEO press note 18.09.2026 + a real Kunigal gap that finally filled — 2026-09-18

Session started from a CEO tweet the user forwarded
(`x.com/ceo_karnataka/status/2100881913506672716`). **x.com is not fetchable
from here** — `WebFetch` returns HTTP 402 on a status URL, so a forwarded
tweet cannot be read directly. Going to
`ceo.karnataka.gov.in/press_releases.html` and taking the newest note is the
working route, and it is what this project should keep doing; the tweet only
ever signals that a new note exists.

### Comparison figures refreshed (commit `992f6cd6d34`, live and verified)

`PRESS NOTE- 18.09.2026.pdf` (note the space after the hyphen — the CEO's
upload filenames are not consistently formatted; 11.09's had none). Parsed
with PyMuPDF the same way as previous notes. Both annexures' sums were
checked against the note's own printed statewide totals before committing:

| | 11.09 | 18.09 | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Electors (Annexure-1) | 4,46,58,413 | **4,47,39,070** | +80,657 |
| Notices generated (Annexure-2) | 43,81,760 | **43,81,945** | +185 |

**A free cross-check worth reusing**: Annexure-2's *Polling Stations* column
sums to exactly **60,923** — this project's own statewide part count, derived
independently by binary-search probing the ECI CDN (section 4f). Per-district
it also matches (Bangalore Urban 3,354, Belgaum 4,644, Kodagu 567). Any
future note whose polling-station column disagrees with `cache/manifest.json`
is worth investigating before trusting either side.

Updated in `docs/app.js`: `CEO_OFFICIAL_ELECTORS`, `CEO_OFFICIAL_TOTAL`,
`CEO_OFFICIAL_NOTICES`, the date strings in both languages; and in
`docs/index.html` the static footer copy plus the press-note link (fetched,
200). Deploy confirmed serving the new figures.

**Deadlines unchanged by this note**: last hearing 12.10.2026, disposal of
claims/objections 22.10.2026, Final Roll 27.10.2026 — same as 11.09's.
`CLAIMS_CLOSE_AT` in `3-build-data.mjs` is still `2026-09-23` and this note
gives no reason to move it (it speaks only to *disposal*, not to the filing
window), but that banner date is now days away and should be re-confirmed
against an ECI source before it lapses.

**New in this note, not previously recorded anywhere**: the CEO acknowledges
directly that electors are failing to find themselves in the part they were
registered in before, because polling stations were rationalised and electors
re-serialised, and directs them to search by EPIC instead. That is precisely
what this site does, and the site's own copy does not currently say it.

### The comparison percentage is now drifting for a reason the UI does not state

The "vs. CEO official count" tile moved **99.4% → 99.2%** on this update. Our
own count did not change and cannot: the draft roll PDFs are a frozen
24.08.2026 snapshot. The CEO's figure, by contrast, grows every week with new
Form-6 registrations. So a growing share of that gap is *not* what
`offsetReasonNote` says it is (OCR-withheld unreadable entries) — it is
electors who were never in the draft roll at all. At +80,657/week this
divergence is roughly 0.18 points per note and will keep widening until the
Final Roll drops on 27.10.2026. **The copy should be updated to name both
causes**; not done here because site wording is a standing user decision
(section 7, item 5).

### Per-district UI numbers audited against the live manifests

Every rendered figure was recomputed from the three live manifests and
compared against the deployed page's own DOM text — all 34 district rows
match, all 34 CEO keys resolve (no `—`), and the district electors sum equals
`manifest.electors` exactly. Elector offsets sit in a tight **97.6-99.7%**
band, consistent with section 10's history.

**One thing the audit surfaced, pre-existing and not caused by this update**:
five districts read **at or above 100%** on notices — Ramanagaram **102.4%**
(20,175 ours vs 19,696 CEO), and Kodagu, Kolar, Udupi and Yadgir each a few
rows over. That contradicts the site's own `offsetReasonNote`, which tells
the reader this column is *expected* to sit under 100% because our dataset
covers one reason-category out of several. Both readings cannot be right. The
likely explanation is duplicate rows surviving the merge (this dataset's
known re-upload pattern, sections 12-14) rather than the CEO under-counting,
but that is a hypothesis — nobody has checked an over-counted district's rows
against its source PDFs. Worth doing before someone points at Ramanagaram as
evidence the data is wrong.

### Tile numbers were breaking mid-group (fixed, `6870fc0a7a7`)

`.tile-value` carries `overflow-wrap: anywhere` and the tiles' grid minimum
was `160px`, which measured out to a 123px text box against 140-166px of
text — so the browser broke the eight-digit values at arbitrary positions and
the page was literally rendering "43,30,781" as `43,30,78` / `1`. Widened the
grid minimum to `210px`; verified in the live page at 1536px and with the
container forced to 330/300/260px that all seven tiles now take one line
each. Worth remembering that Indian digit grouping makes these values ~11
characters — any new tile, or a narrower breakpoint, needs re-measuring
rather than eyeballing.

### The statewide Drive crawl found exactly one new thing: Kunigal is real now

Ran checklist item 3 (section 13) properly: re-scraped
`ceo.karnataka.gov.in/notices_issued.html` first and diffed all 34 folder IDs
against `DISTRICT_FOLDERS` — **no drift**, every ID still current (the
Vijayapura-style link move from section 12 has not recurred). Then a full
crawl: **50,640 PDFs across 34 districts, 0 district-level failures**, 1
unhandled `.rar` (Ramanagara's known one).

Diffed by `fileId` against the previous crawl (2026-09-16), rather than
against a remembered number:

- **Tumkur `131-Kunigal`: 177 files removed, 257 added.** The 177 that
  vanished are exactly the misfiled `ac137`-named Pavagada duplicates
  section 14 identified. The 257 new ones are all named `ac131`. **Verified
  by content, not by filename** (this project's standing requirement):
  downloaded `..._ac131_part10.pdf` (fileId
  `1-AhaAiuBQtysmdmYRqnz_hMe1Rks9o2W`) and read it with PyMuPDF — its own
  header says `AC No and Name: 131 - Kunigal`, `Part No and Name: 10 -
  Government Lower Primary School`, Template A, real EPICs and reasons. The
  district office has replaced the wrongly-uploaded folder with genuine
  Kunigal content. **Section 14's conclusion — "AC131 has never had genuine
  source PDFs, nothing to chase unless that changes on a future crawl" — is
  now superseded; it changed.**
- **Gulbarga: one file removed** (`..._ac45_part262.pdf`), nothing added in
  that district. A single part withdrawn at source, already published; no
  action, noted so a future crawl diff does not read it as new.
- Statewide, **AC131 was the only AC with crawled files and zero published
  rows**. The 8 ACs that look like the reverse (published rows, no crawled
  files — Nargund, Hadagali, Hagaribommanahalli, Vijayanagara, Harapanahalli,
  Harihar, Honnali, Kollegal) are the known zip and Template-C cases whose
  filenames carry no `_acNNN_`; 2,152 files statewide are unlabelled that
  way, so a filename-derived AC map cannot see them. Not gaps.

Triggered `Import notices data` after checking with the user (run
`35376116910`, started 17:44Z) — the shared-state-Actions confirmation habit
from section 14. **Expected effect, written down before the result so it can
be checked honestly**: Tumkur's notices column should rise from its current
**83.4%** of the CEO figure (93,299 / 1,11,875), the lowest in the state, and
AC131 should stop reading zero. If Tumkur does *not* move, the first thing to
check is whether these new files' EPICs are already published under AC137 —
the same duplicate-merge outcome section 14 measured, just with correct
filenames this time.

### Machine state at the start of this session

No `node.exe` processes running — the exhaustive sweep
(`14-exhaustive-sweep.mjs`) and the test-log committer
(`16-commit-test-log.mjs`) were both stopped, last test-log commit
2026-09-17 17:01Z, with one uncommitted line still sitting in
`test-logs/test-log.jsonl`. Neither was restarted this session; nothing above
depends on them.

### Import result — the prediction held, and Kunigal is genuinely new data

Run `35376116910` finished **success in 58m39s**, published build
`2026-09-18T18:42:00.769Z`. Checked against the live manifest fetched fresh
(cache-busted), not against the workflow's own log:

**Exactly two ACs changed statewide**, and both were predicted by the crawl
diff before the run started:

| AC | | rows | partsWithData |
|---|---|---|---|
| 131 Kunigal (Tumkur) | **new** | 0 → **9,625** | 0 → **257** |
| 45 Gulbarga Uttar | withdrawn file | 25,585 → 25,529 (−56) | 296 → 295 |

AC45's −56 is precisely the single source file the crawl diff found deleted
(`..._ac45_part262.pdf`) — a satisfying closed loop: the diff predicted both
changes and the import produced exactly those two, nothing else moved.

**AC137 Pavagada is unchanged at 6,342 rows**, which is the important
negative result. Section 14's worry was that the Kunigal folder would turn
out to be Pavagada's rows again under better filenames, in which case the
merge would have deduplicated them into nothing. It did not: 9,625 genuinely
new electors landed, and Pavagada did not move a single row.

Statewide notices **4,330,781 → 4,340,350** (+9,569 = 9,625 − 56), ACs with
data **220 → 221**.

**UI effect**: the "Notice records" tile reads 43,40,350 and "vs. CEO notices
count" **98.8% → 99.1%**. Tumkur's district row moves **83.4% → 92.0%**
(1,02,924 of 1,11,875) and is no longer the state's outlier — Hassan (88.6%)
now is.

**Verified end-to-end against the deployed tree, not just the manifest.**
Four EPICs read by eye out of the downloaded source PDF
(`..._ac131_part10.pdf`) were run through `docs/app.js`'s own lookup path
(SHA-256 → `bucketPath` → suffix match) over real HTTP against
`data-notices`: `RVP4772265`, `RVP4771838`, `RVP4971479` and `GFC2120020`
all resolve to AC131 part 10 at serials 6, 19, 52 and 98, with reason, age,
gender and name matching the PDF field for field. The published `fileId`
also points at the correct `131-Kunigal` file, so the cosmetic
wrong-folder-link issue section 14 recorded does not apply to these rows.

**Still true after this run**: AC131 now has 257 of its 270 parts, so 13
Kunigal booths remain without source PDFs — ordinary sparse upload, the same
shape as most districts, not a gap to chase.

## 16. Pre-retirement completeness sweep — 2026-09-22

User plans to retire the site within days and asked for a final sweep so no
source data is left unread. Started from CEO tweet
`x.com/ceo_karnataka/status/2101684613467033902` (read via Claude in Chrome;
WebFetch still 402s on x.com): a 20.09.2026 note on Special Campaign
Form 6/7/8 receipts (79,897 over 19-20 Sep). **Not** an Annexure-1/2 note, so
the CEO comparison figures in `app.js` stay on 18.09.2026, which is still the
newest statewide note on `press_releases.html`.

**Roll: unchanged, verified.** 8 ACs sampled: Revision1 still
`Last-Modified: 24 Aug 2026`, Revision2/3 404. All 224 ACs probed at
maxPart+1 and +2: all 404. Parts are contiguous 1..N everywhere (60,923).

**ASD: unchanged, verified.** The 187 booths with zero ASD rows were all
re-probed: still 404 (no report). 15 sampled existing reports still dated
21 Aug 2026.

**Notices: source unchanged since 18 Sep.** Fresh crawl of all 34
districts: 50,640 files, a fileId diff against the 18 Sep crawl shows
0 added / 0 removed, and all 34 folder IDs still match `notices_issued.html`.
A full sweep (`scripts/audit-notices-drive.mjs`) listed *every* entry of any
type: only 22 non-PDF items statewide. 18 WhatsApp photos (Mandya 188), a
`winrar.exe` (Shimoga 111, not touched), a Word letter about two individual
cases (BBMP Central 164), two per-part **count** sheets (Mandya 186, 192),
and one real gap:

- **Mandya AC192 K.R.Pete `...No Mapping XL Data.xlsx`: an elector-level
  list (EPIC, part, serial, name, mapping category), 12,510 EPICs.**
  Cross-checked against the AC's own PDFs: 11,965 overlap and all agree on
  part+serial. It adds **545 electors**, 544 of them in 12 booths that have
  no PDF. Pipeline now reads `.xlsx` (`17-discover-notices.mjs` collects
  them; `18-extract-notices.py` `read_xlsx_rows`, run in batches after every
  PDF batch so first-seen dedupe keeps the richer PDF row; the workflow
  installs `openpyxl`). Count-only sheets yield 0 rows by design. Local
  test: AC192 12,328 → 12,873 rows, 253 → 265 parts with data.
- Ramanagara's `183-Ramanagara Discrepency.rar` is byte-for-name identical
  to the extracted folder beside it (255 = 255 filenames). Not a gap.
- The only folder that could hint at a listing cap (Davanagere
  `110-HONNALI`, exactly 1,024 entries) belongs to a district already within
  12 notices of the CEO count.

**Why notices will still read ~99%, not 100%** (41.6K short of 43,81,945
before this fix): booths never uploaded. Belgaum ACs 4/6/13 have no folder;
Arsikere 68/281, Koratagere 59/256, Pavagada 177/251, Vijayanagar(167)
263/284. Drive file counts match our parts-with-data one-for-one there, and
ECI's CDN does not host these reports (probed; the ASD control URL 200s).
Nothing further to fetch unless a district uploads more.

**Import result, verified against the deployed site.** Run `35761838538`
succeeded; build `2026-09-22T18:33:22.013Z`, commit `d9b7a1e4f`. Statewide
4,340,350 → **4,340,895** (+545 exactly); Mandya job read `{'A': 1804,
'xlsx': 3}`. Live AC192: **12,873 rows, 265 parts with data**. Live lookups
via the app's own SHA-256 bucket path: sheet-only `YTE2798502` and
`YTE4155503` resolve to AC192 part 73 (serials 305, 484, reason `PROGENY`,
no age/gender), and `YTE2074110`, which is in both sources, still carries its
PDF row (`Parent Age Difference <15`, 67, M). That confirms the PDF-first
ordering held.

## 17. Archival — final state, what was lost, how to rebuild — 2026-09-23

The author deleted the local working copy after this commit and plans to
retire the site within days. This section is the complete picture for anyone
(or any session) who picks the repo up from a fresh clone.

### Final published state (verified live 2026-09-22/23)

| Dataset | Live figures | Source status at archival |
|---|---|---|
| Draft roll (`docs/data`, built 2026-08-30) | 224/224 ACs, 60,923/60,923 parts, 4,43,85,225 electors (99.2% of the CEO's 18.09 figure, see section 15 on why that drifts) | ECI still serves only `Revision1`, all dated 24 Aug 2026; no new parts in any AC (section 16) |
| ASD (`docs/data-asd`, built 2026-08-30) | 224/224 ACs, 100% of parts, 10,766,778 rows | Unchanged; the 187 booths with no report are still 404 at ECI |
| Notices (`docs/data-notices`, built 2026-09-22T18:33Z) | 221/224 ACs, 4,340,895 rows = 99.06% of CEO Annexure-2 (43,81,945) | Nothing added to any of the 34 Drive folders since 18 Sep; the remaining gap is booths never uploaded (section 16) |

CEO comparison figures in `docs/app.js` are from the 18.09.2026 press note,
which was still the newest statewide note at archival (the 20.09 note is
Form 6/7/8 campaign counts only). Claims/objections closed 23.09.2026; the
Final Roll is due 27.10.2026 and will supersede everything this site shows.

### What lives in the repo (survives) vs what was lost

**In git, enough to keep the site running indefinitely:** all code, the
three published trees under `docs/` (~3 GB, served by GitHub Pages straight
from `main` — `docs/config.js` points at `./data*`, R2 was never used),
`seed/ac-metadata.json` (AC names, districts, part counts), `test-logs/`,
`reports/`, and this file.

**Lost with the local `cache/` (9.4 GB, gitignored):**
- `cache/rows/*.jsonl` — raw roll OCR rows *with plaintext EPICs*, including
  the ~5.9% withheld (`ok:false`) rows that never reached the site.
- `cache/asd-rows/*.jsonl` (3.0 GB) — raw ASD rows.
- `cache/manifest.json` (regenerable: `scripts/1-discover.mjs`),
  `cache/build-state.json`, the exhaustive-sweep ledgers, the
  confirmed-corrections JSONs and OCR review crops, `notices-manifest.json`.
- `cache-bihar/`, `data-bihar/` — an early calibration run on Bihar
  (S04, AC170 Barbigha, 45/275 parts). Unrelated to Karnataka, not needed.

**The consequence that matters most:** published buckets store only a
SHA-256 suffix per record, never the EPIC. **Nothing in this repo can
list or recover the EPICs.** Any roll or ASD correction needs the affected
source PDFs re-read from the ECI CDN (still public, section 2).

### Rebuilding from a fresh clone — and the one command not to run

**Do NOT run `scripts/3-build-data.mjs` or `scripts/10-build-asd-data.mjs`
from a fresh clone.** With no `cache/build-state.json`, the roll build falls
back to a full rebuild, and both builds start with `rm` of their published
tree (`docs/data`, `docs/data-asd`). Unless all 224 ACs were re-extracted
first (roll OCR ≈ 9-10 parts/min, i.e. ~4-5 days statewide; ASD ≈ 2.4 h), that
would wipe the live dataset down to whatever was re-extracted.

- **Correct specific roll records** (e.g. the AC112 and duplicate-EPIC items
  below): follow `scripts/fix-ac161-wzu-wzz.mjs`. It edits only the bucket
  files involved, removing the record from the wrong EPIC's bucket (matched on
  suffix + ac/part/serial, not suffix alone) and inserting it into the right
  one. Works without `cache/`. Verify afterwards with the live lookup path.
- **Re-extract one roll AC** for inspection: `node scripts/1-discover.mjs`
  then `python scripts/2-extract.py` for that AC (~30 min per AC), then patch
  buckets as above. Do not publish via the build.
- **Notices** are safe to re-import from anywhere: `gh workflow run
  "Import notices data"`. It crawls and extracts fresh on Actions runners
  and merges into the committed `docs/data-notices`, with a coverage guard.
  Check for new source files first (`node scripts/17-discover-notices.mjs`,
  then diff by `fileId`), per section 13.
- **Audit tools that need no cache:** `node scripts/notices-gap-report.mjs`
  (per-district shortfall vs the CEO, live), `node
  scripts/audit-notices-drive.mjs` (every file of any type in all 34 Drive
  trees), `node scripts/recheck-roll-site-fails.mjs` (re-tests every logged
  roll site failure against the live site).

### Open issues at archival — none fixed

1. **AC112 part 202 serial 476: `INA8000960` should be `INA1800960`**
   (section 1). Unfixed; fixable with the bucket-patch pattern above.
2. **Two roll EPICs resolve to the wrong booth live**, found 2026-09-23 by
   re-checking all 265 roll site failures in the test log: 263 now pass
   (transient load/Pages failures during the sweep, the section 11
   contention pattern), 2 do not:
   - `YER9475500`: source PDF says AC176 part 558 serial 100; live says
     AC176 part 13 serial 120.
   - `YII3181922`: source PDF says AC130 part 60 serial 310; live says
     AC218 part 55 serial 147.
   Most likely the same EPIC printed on two booths (or an OCR misread on one),
   where the build keeps the first row it sees. Not investigated further.
3. **Roll exhaustive sweep stopped at 49,853/60,923 booths** (2026-09-17)
   and was not resumed. Its ledger lived in `cache/`, so it cannot resume.
   The test log holds every result so far: roll site 49,703 pass / 265 fail
   (see item 2), roll pdf 49,467 pass / 346 fail (pdf-layer failures, i.e.
   the sweep's own fresh OCR disagreeing with the published row; only the
   AC161 WZU/WZZ subset was ever analysed). ASD sweep completed: 60,732 site
   pass / 8 fail.
4. **Notices over 100% in five districts** (Ramanagaram 102.4%, Udupi,
   Kodagu, Kolar, Yadgir marginally), which contradicts `offsetReasonNote`'s
   claim that the column should sit under 100% (section 15). Unexplained.
   Separately, most districts match the CEO count to within 0.5%, which
   suggests the CEO's Annexure-2 counts the same notices these PDFs list, and
   that note's "one category among several" wording is probably wrong.
5. **The elector comparison drifts** as the CEO's figure grows with new
   Form-6 registrations while the draft roll is frozen; the UI copy still
   attributes the whole gap to OCR-withheld rows (section 15).
6. **Section 7's open decisions** (withheld rows, booth names, wording)
   were never taken. Item 3 there (BBMP scope) is obsolete: all 224 ACs,
   including BBMP, are covered.
7. `test-logs/test-log.jsonl` is ~65 MB, above GitHub's 50 MB warning
   (hard limit 100 MB). Committed as-is at archival; nothing appends to it
   any more.

### Retiring the site

Disabling Pages (repo Settings → Pages) takes the site down and keeps
everything else. Archiving the repo does **not** stop Pages serving.
Deleting the `docs/data*` trees from `main` would also take the searches
down but leaves them in history.

### Operational lessons worth keeping

- `x.com` status links cannot be fetched by WebFetch (HTTP 402); open them
  in a real browser, or go straight to `ceo.karnataka.gov.in/press_releases.html`.
- Drive's `uc?export=download` serves a virus-scan interstitial for
  multi-MB files; use `drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=…&confirm=t`
  (now done for `.xlsx` in `18-extract-notices.py`).
- Never delete a log file a running process still has open for writing;
  truncate it instead.
- Don't run the roll sweep and a notices extraction at full worker counts on
  one machine at once (section 11).
